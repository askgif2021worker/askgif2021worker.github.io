Most often they know how to convert a word file into PDF but when the question raises &ldquo;how to convert a PDF to word&rdquo;, they feel uncomfortable about it. In real scenario, it&rsquo;s actually a very easy task which can be accomplished by using an online service for file conversion known as Zamzar. However going for Excel and JPG conversion requires two steps, but again they are fairly easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/5bb1682c-da74-4c9e-8633-09701b7e13e5_pdf-to-word.jpg","subContents":[{"SubTitle":"An easy way of converting a PDF files to JPG","SubTitleHindi":null,"SubContent":"<p>After logging on to ZamZar.com, under Step two browse the PDF file on your computer and choose the option of PNG format for the format conversion. PNG is also a type of picture format being excessively used these days, and most of the applications supporting JPG also support PNG. Each page of the PDF document is transformed into PNG image format by ZamZar. Further, you can open up each of those pictures with Microsoft Paint and simply choose the Save As option under File tab followed by choosing the option JPEG from the format drop down lists in the pop up box.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Second way of Converting PDF into a JPG Format</strong><br />\r\nTo start with, you must first download a freeware that readily converts a PDF doc to a required JPEG format. One of the software of this kind is available at the download page of Omniformat from where you may download Omniformat version 8.5 along with PDF995. PDF995 must be installed before installing the Omniformat. After completing the installation of both the programs go to your start menu to find the Software995 group of programs and click on Omniformat.<br />\r\nThe only feature of the program that you may not like is that you will be forced to view some ads for about initial 30 seconds. But somehow it&rsquo;s much better than paying a wholesome amount for a simple task of file conversion. It also pops up other tabs of your browser to open up the sponsored links, but for sure it does not mount any malware on your system. After loading of the program completes you&rsquo;ll be able to see a section named &ldquo;Watch Folders&rdquo; and few buttons such as &ldquo;Single Pass&rdquo; and &ldquo;Start Monitoring&rdquo;.<br />\r\nNow you are required to make a copy of your PDF files to be converted into JPEG and paste them into the folder at C:\\pmniformat\\watch and select the option saying Single Pass. Program will automatically access the directory and convert every page of each PDF file into a JPG file. If you choose the &ldquo;Start Monitoring&rdquo; option instead, you will be required to drop PDF&rsquo;s into the watch folder while the program is in execution. One must keep a note that program deletes every PDF file it uses for conversion in the watch folder, so PDF documents should only be copied to the destination folder and shouldn&rsquo;t be moved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Converting a PDF doc to a Word format</strong><br />\r\nVisit the Zamzar.com and select the Browse option for uploading your PDF file in the Step 1. Next in Step 2 DOC format will be selected by default, however you may also choose among Text, RTF, HTML etc. Finally you need to give your email ID in Step 3.<br />\r\nVery soon you&rsquo;ll be receiving an email containing the download link for the converted file. This site works accurately for even very complex PDF&rsquo;s containing multiple images, column wise texts etc.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Converting a PDF doc to an Excel format</strong><br />\r\nFollow the above steps using ZamZar.com, but in Step 2 while choosing the format go for TXT. There is no facility for direct conversion to Excel sheets, so you first need to convert into a text file. Download and save the text file on your computer system. Further, you need to open the Microsoft Excel application and go to Open option under File tab and modify the combo box stating &ldquo;Files of types&rdquo; to &ldquo;All types:<br />\r\nConverted text file must be visible under the &ldquo;list of files&rdquo;. On opening this file you&rsquo;ll land into the &ldquo;Text Import Wizard&rdquo;. You must open the file in this style only, because directly opening the file with excel will bring down text of each row to appear into a single column without any separation.<br />\r\nNow in step 1, go for the option saying Delimited among the two available options. After selecting Next, go for checking off the Space checkbox. Select Next again and then the Finish button. Finally, you can save the file as excel file by selecting the option which says Save as under the File tab. There are some Drawbacks also associated with this process as it&rsquo;s not cent percent efficient. Like, if original sheet contained some columns with texts having multiple spaces in it then here it would appear in a format where each word has in its own column. Also, there won&rsquo;t be any mathematical formulas or pre defined functions which might have been used in the original Excel sheet.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>","SubContentHindi":null,"ImageUrl":"97824257-72c7-496f-add2-bf14607043fd_pdf-to-word-free.png","HdImageUrl":null,"gifUrl":null,"Priority":""}],"category":{"name":"informatives","slug":"informatives"},"slug":"how-to-convert-a-pdf-to-word","tags":[{"name":"word","slug":"word"},{"name":"computer","slug":"computer"},{"name":"pdf","slug":"pdf"}],"recommendations":[{"id":12,"title":"Few good registry cleaners","imageUrl":"0f876cbe-4827-4c62-b6ed-53d02bbbdc39_RegEdit.gif","dateCreated":"2018-07-03T17:46:00.093Z","dateModified":"2018-07-03T18:03:13.3Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"If you are in search of a &ldquo;Free registry cleaners&rdquo; then you may come across thousands of them readily available over internet, but only few of them can be trusted and can be tried without risking your computer.
