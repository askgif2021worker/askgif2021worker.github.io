It lies 347 km (215 miles) north of Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal. Mango, jute and silk are the most notable products of this district. The special variety of mango, Fazli, produced in this region is popularly known by the name of the district and is exported across the world and internationally acclaimed. The folk culture of gombhira is a feature of the district, being a unique way of representation of joy and sorrow of daily life of the common people, as well as the unique medium of presentation on national and international matters. According to the National Investigation Agency Malda is believed to be a hub of a fake currency racket. It is reported that 90 per cent of the fake currency that enters India originates in Malda.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>District headquarters is English Bazar, also known as Malda, which was once the capital of Bengal. The district maintains the traditions of the past in culture and education. Old Malda, the town which lies just east of the confluence of the Mahananda and Kalindi rivers, is part of the English Bazar metropolitan city. The town rose to prominence as the river port of the old capital of Pandua. During the 18th century it was the seat of prosperous cotton and silk industries. It remains an important distributing centre for rice, jute, and wheat. The area between the historical monument of Jame Masjid (1566) and the landmark of Nimasarai tower across the river Mahananda, constituted a municipality in 1867. Rice, jute, legumes, and oilseed are the chief crops in the surrounding area. Malda is the largest producer of excellent quality of jute in India. Mulberry plantations and mango orchards occupy large areas; mango trade and silk manufacture are the main economic activities. The Independence Day of Malda is 17 August 1947.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Culture</p>\r\n<p>Malda has special cultural sorts like Gombhira, Alkap, Kavigan etc.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Festivals</p>\r\n<p>Almost all of the major religious festivals are celebrated, like</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Durga puja</p>\r\n<p>Kali Puja</p>\r\n<p>Diwali</p>\r\n<p>Dussehra</p>\r\n<p>Bhogta mela</p>\r\n<p>Eid al-Adha</p>\r\n<p>Muharram</p>\r\n<p>Milad un-Nabi</p>\r\n<p>Shab-e-Barat</p>\r\n<p>Guru Nanak Jayanti</p>\r\n<p>Christmas</p>\r\n<p>Ratha-Yatra</p>\r\n<p>Maha Shivratri</p>\r\n<p>Fairs</p>\r\n<p>Some of the mostly reputed cultural fairs of the district are</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Aiho and Bulbulchandi ' Kali Puja Fair</p>\r\n<p>Charu Babu Mela</p>\r\n<p>Charak Fair</p>\r\n<p>Chobbish (24) Prahor at Shingabad and Rishipur</p>\r\n<p>Dariapur Urush at Dariapur, Kaliachak</p>\r\n<p>Gazole Utsab</p>\r\n<p>Kahala Urush at Mothabari</p>\r\n<p>Kahala Durga Puja Fair .</p>\r\n<p>Kartik puja Fair</p>\r\n<p>Moyna Bishohari Mela.</p>\r\n<p>Eid Fair, Pirana Pir Dargah</p>\r\n<p>Muharram Fair, at Sattari</p>\r\n<p>Maha Shivratri Fair or Bhole Bam at Amrity</p>\r\n<p>Ramkeli Fair, Gour</p>\r\n<p>Christmas Carnival, Englishbazar, Malda</p>\r\n<p>32 prahar harinam sankirtan at Debipur (Ratua 1,Malda)</p>\r\n<p>Places of interest</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Early 19th century lithograph of the Muslim ruins of Dakhil Darwaza at Gour</p>\r\n<p>Adina Relics</p>\r\n<p>Adina Mosque</p>\r\n<p>Gol ghar</p>\r\n<p>Eklakhi mosque</p>\r\n<p>Adina deer park</p>\r\n<p>Relics of Gour</p>\r\n<p>Firoz minar</p>\r\n<p>Chika Masjid</p>\r\n<p>Qutwali Gate</p>\r\n<p>12-gated mosque</p>\r\n<p>Qudm-e-Rasul, shrine believed to contain footprint of the Prophet</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Temple of Jahura Kali Bari, Malda</p>\r\n<p>Aquatic Bengal</p>\r\n<p>Jami Masjid</p>\r\n<p>Nimai Sarai Tower</p>\r\n<p>Pandua Sharif</p>\r\n<p>Pirana Pir Dargah.</p>\r\n<p>Lost monastery of Jagjivanpur</p>\r\n<p>Temple of Ramakrishna Mission</p>\r\n<p>Temple of Jahura Kali (Local avatar of Goddess Chandi)</p>\r\n<p>Chanchal palace</p>\r\n<p>Sattari Jame Mosque</p>\r\n<p>Debipur Radhagobinda Temple(Debipur,Ratua 1,Malda)</p>\r\n<p>Amrity Shiv Mandir</p>\r\n<p>NAGHARIA</p>\r\n<p>Education</p>\r\n<p>Schools</p>\r\n<p>Though Malda is one of the least educated districts of West Bengal, it contains some of the &eacute;lite schools of the state.</p>\r\n<p>Notable schools of the district include:-</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A.
