A tree is an example of non-linear data structures. A Tree structure is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form.</p>\r\n<p>In trees ADT(Abstract Datta Type), an order of the elements is not important. If we need ordering information linear data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, etc. can be used.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Binary Tree</p>\r\n<p>A tree is called a binary tree if each node has zero child, one child or two children. An empty tree is also a valid binary tree. We can visualize a binary tree as consisting of a root and two disjoint binary trees, called the left and right subtrees of the root.</p>\r\n<p>Types of Binary Trees</p>\r\n<p>- Strict Binary Tree: A binary tree is called a strict binary tree if each node has exactly two children or no children.</p>\r\n<p>- Full Binary Tree: A binary tree is called a full binary tree if each node has exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at same level.</p>\r\n<p>- Complete Binary Tree: Before defining the complete binary tree, let us assume that the height of the binary tree&nbsp;is h. In a complete binary tree, if we give numbering for&nbsp;the nodes by starting at the root then we get a complete sequence from 1 to a number of nodes in the tree. while traversing we should give numbering for NULL pointers also. A binary tree is called a complete binary tree if all leaf nodes are at height h or h-1 and also without any missing number in the sequence.</p>\r\n<p>source: Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy in Java ( By Narasimha Karumanchi )</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/503573f2-35b2-4cd4-bf84-46f6f1792a74_Binary_tree.png","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"coding","slug":"coding"},"slug":"what-is-a-tree-data-structure","tags":[{"name":"tree","slug":"tree"},{"name":"interview","slug":"interview"},{"name":"प्रशन","slug":"questions"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1595,"title":"Cousins in Binary Tree - Tree - Easy - LeetCode","imageUrl":"icon_249b4ce9-a2e8-4b2a-a369-264d0c802503.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-10-09T09:24:10.362Z","dateModified":"2020-10-09T09:24:23.315Z","contributedBy":"sumitc91","content":"In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth k node are at depth k+1.\nTwo nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth, but have different parents.\nWe are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values x and y of two","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/249b4ce9-a2e8-4b2a-a369-264d0c802503.jpg","category":{"name":"coding","slug":"coding"},"tags":[{"name":"algorithm","slug":"algorithm"},{"name":"binary-tree","slug":"binary-tree"},{"name":"डेटा-संरचना","slug":"data-structure"},{"name":"आसान","slug":"easy"},{"name":"leetcode","slug":"leetcode"},{"name":"tree","slug":"tree"}],"slug":"cousins-in-binary-tree-tree-easy-leetcode","total":0},{"id":146,"title":"Xamarin.forms shared project gives error while creation","imageUrl":"63ea6650-3931-4a59-aad2-bb51e06cd6cd_xamarin-forms.png","dateCreated":"2018-10-26T05:01:17.134Z","dateModified":"2018-10-26T05:02:27.883Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Whenever I try to create a new xamarin.forms project it is giving error.
