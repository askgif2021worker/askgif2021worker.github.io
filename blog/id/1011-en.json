When a couple starts living under the same roof, they are generally in their best behaviour for the initial weeks. The real struggle starts when the honeymoon phase is over and the couple starts leading their normal life. Remember, the first few months of the marriage play a very critical part in building the foundation and strengthening this relationship. Here are seven innocent mistakes that can impact a marriage and create cracks in this relationship in the long run.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Adjusting with in-laws</p>\r\n<p>It creates resentment and misunderstanding in a couple&rsquo;s married life when one partner is unwilling or continuously struggling to bond with the spouse&rsquo;s parents. Whether you are living in the same house with your in-laws or not, they will always be a part of your married life. Both the partners must take their time to understand their perception, adjust a bit to accommodate their wishes and develop a healthy rapport with them.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Not managing finance wisely</p>\r\n<p>Love cannot pay bills and having a clear understanding on how to manage financial burden together can cut down a major amount of unnecessary stress in the relationship. Some couples avoid the &lsquo;money talk&rsquo; to escape an argument but sooner or later, their marriage might suffer because of distrust and lack of communication.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lack of communication</p>\r\n<p>Talking about communication, it is something that can make or break a marriage. How can a relationship go the distance if one or both the partners have to think twice before saying anything to each other or find it difficult to express things that are bothering them? The relationship is bound to hit a rough patch when you cannot talk about the things that matter to you with your &lsquo;soulmate&rsquo; and plan to share your entire life with him or her.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Unequal distribution of household chores</p>\r\n<p>Only one partner cannot take the burden of running the entire household smoothly and be responsible for doing every single chore to perfection. Both the spouses need to equally distribute the household duties and be the ideal couple who actually support each other in every task.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Not talking about debt</p>\r\n<p>Again, money matters can make the happiest and healthiest relationship go awry. If one of the partners has not disclosed his or her financial debts (if any) or any major recurrent expenditures, it is going to be a rude shock for the other one.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Not disclosing the past that matters</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, your past can have a brutal impact on your present life. It is always better to discuss your previous relationships with your partner before marriage and start with a clean slate. Do we really need to explain why?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Fighting and holding grudges</p>\r\n<p>Every couple fights, but the way you resolve it makes all the difference. The first six months of your marriage might witness several arguments, differences in opinion and how a couple approaches the same situation differently. What matters is how both respect each other's point of view, resolve the conflict and happily find a middle ground.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>source: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/love-sex/7-innocent-mistakes-that-can-damage-a-marriage-in-the-first-six-months/photostory/68906041.cms?picid=68906042</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/260fb731-81be-43f7-9bed-b99e8b388015_marriage.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"life-hacks","slug":"life-hacks"},"slug":"few-innocent-mistakes-that-can-damage-a-marriage-in-the-first-six-months","tags":[{"name":"marriage","slug":"marriage"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1021,"title":"Moments that occur only in the first two months of marriage.","imageUrl":"b6eff7d7-01e7-4a46-b3d8-1b362dd4acef_wild-honeymoon.jpg","dateCreated":"2019-12-02T02:00:32.711Z","dateModified":"2019-12-02T02:00:55.128Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"No matter how long a courtship period you had with your partner before marriage or the number of years you have dated your lover, life takes a turn once you get married.
