As per studies, when you don't have enough sex, your body doesn't produce the necessary hormones to make you want to have it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That probably explains why it's difficult for a lot of people to break their dry spell!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Here's are 9 health issues you're at the risk of if you don't have enough sex:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1. Common Cold &amp; Flu</p>\r\n<p>Sex produces various antibodies that help strengthen your immune system helping you fight allergic reactions, colds, and flu.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. Increased Pain During PMS</p>\r\n<p>Balancing out the testosterone and estrogen levels in the body, sex works at keeping the hormonal level in the body. And when women go without sex for a long period, excessive estrogen doesn't get used, resulting in excessively painful cramps during their period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. High Blood Pressure&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Since it's famous for its stress-reducing effects, lack of sex could have a reverse effect resulting in an increase in blood pressure or hypertension.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4. Prostate Cancer</p>\r\n<p>As per studies, the more sexually-active men are, the less is their chances of developing cancer in their prostate gland. This is because when men ejaculate, they end up emptying out particularly harmful particles from their prostrate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>5. Stress &amp; Anxiety</p>\r\n<p>Just like exercise, sex also releases endorphins (happy hormones) and oxytocin which help you deal with overwhelming situations. And when you're not having sex, studies show that you're at a much higher risk of suffering from excessive anxiety.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>6. Lack Of Sleep</p>\r\n<p>As per studies, having sex releases the hormone prolactin that aides sleep. And when you're not having sex, you won't feel sleepy so easily.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>7. Weakened Bladder</p>\r\n<p>As you'd already know, having sex is the best workout for your kegel muscles, the ones that aid your bladder in holding onto pee. And studies show that when you're not having regular sex unless you're regularly doing other kegel exercises, you'd be rushing to the toilet way too often.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>8. Erectile Dysfunction&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When a penis doesn't get regular erections, due to the man not having enough sex, it can slow down the muscles or weaken them. Multiple studies have proved that men who go long periods without sexual intercourse are most likely to develop erectile dysfunction.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>9. Weakened Vaginal Walls</p>\r\n<p>Increased sexual activity boosts blood flow in a woman's vagina and when she doesn't have enough sex, the tissues of the vaginal walls dry out and weaken, making it lose and thin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>source: https://www.scoopwhoop.com/9-health-issues-if-you-dont-have-regular-sex/</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/e85166f3-cda5-4b89-9e06-47ac5bc95060_couple-silent-treatment.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"life-hacks","slug":"life-hacks"},"slug":"unknown-health-problems-you-can-get-if-youre-not-having-sex-regularly","tags":[{"name":"love","slug":"love"},{"name":"sexless-marriages","slug":"sexless-marriages"}],"recommendations":[{"id":919,"title":"Are Men Afraid of Smarter Women?
