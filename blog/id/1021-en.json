You start sharing a roof (and your life) with your partner and in-laws, and you take your own time to adjust to this new lifestyle. Here are a few things that usually happen in the initial months of marriage with every couple.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1. ​You discover their new habits</p>\r\n<p>From the very first day of this conjugal bond, you will discover the habits of your partner which you never knew existed. What your partner does before hitting the bed, the way they behave in front of their parents, their morning rituals, their bathroom habits, and several other habits that might be weird for you. The first few months of your marriage would be all about observing and adapting to each other's style of living.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. ​The first argument</p>\r\n<p>Countless thoughts might trouble your mind the day you will have your first serious argument or fight with your partner. Have I made the right choice? Would it be right to apologize and adjust? Whom should I confess about this fight? Oh, wait! Will my partner share this with his parents? But slowly and gradually, as your relationship stands the test of time, you find ways to deal with little quarrels.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. ​Money matters</p>\r\n<p>You both might have different spending habits and might have to struggle a little to find a middle path after tying the knot. You might not like your husband&rsquo;s frugal ways of living or he might raise eyebrows when you splurge on online shopping. It would take some time and serious discussions to figure out a mutually acceptable way of managing the finances.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4. ​You will enjoy this new status</p>\r\n<p>Like other newly-married couples, you too will enjoy this new relationship status. You might feel proud and happy when someone addresses you as a 'wife' or 'husband'. Your conversations with friends and family would also revolve around your spouse and married life, your last trip together, future plans, the relationship you share with your in-laws and the list is endless.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>5. ​You will go down the memory lane</p>\r\n<p>For the first few months, you both will talk about your wedding and go down the memory lane. From the nosy relatives who gossiped, the ones who did not like the food, the hectic and extravagant wedding preparations to the time you spent together during the honeymoon, you will always have something to talk about while cuddling in the bed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>6. ​What about me-time?</p>\r\n<p>You might find yourself a lot busier after getting hitched. You will spend most of your spare time catching up with your partner, in-laws and friend circle, going for dinner or lunch with relatives, doing household chores, etc. Amidst all this, you will crave for me-time and might even miss your bachelor days when you were on your own and had ample free time in hand.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/b6eff7d7-01e7-4a46-b3d8-1b362dd4acef_wild-honeymoon.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"life-hacks","slug":"life-hacks"},"slug":"moments-that-occur-only-in-the-first-two-months-of-marriage","tags":[{"name":"marriage","slug":"marriage"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1021,"title":"Moments that occur only in the first two months of marriage.","imageUrl":"b6eff7d7-01e7-4a46-b3d8-1b362dd4acef_wild-honeymoon.jpg","dateCreated":"2019-12-02T02:00:32.711Z","dateModified":"2019-12-02T02:00:55.128Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"No matter how long a courtship period you had with your partner before marriage or the number of years you have dated your lover, life takes a turn once you get married.
