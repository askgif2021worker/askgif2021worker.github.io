This is a simple puree which can be mixed with rice porridge or any other porridges too.</p>\r\n<p>For a variation, I made beetroot puree as well. So it is more healthy and nutritious. Beetroots have not only the amazing color, but it is also rich in antioxidants, folate, manganese, potassium, vitamin A and many other properties. So it is good for your babies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>1)The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.</p>\r\n<p>2)Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3)I don&rsquo;t prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day. But if you are busy or find difficult to get time, then freeze it in individual containers and thaw it overnight in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>4)After having this puree, your baby's poop will be red in color.
