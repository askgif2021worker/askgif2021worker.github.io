You can start feeding it as soon as your baby starts their solids. Since it is easy to digest, they are great weaning food. Avocado is rich in omega 3 which helps in brain development in babies. You can add some banana to this puree, it adds potassium too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Avocados are high in monounsaturated fat, that&rsquo;s the good kind of fat! A medium-sized avocado contains approximately 322 calories and up to 30 grams of fat &ndash; WOW. 1 cup of avocado puree contains almost 700 calories as it would take approximately 2 avocados to make a cup. The benefits of avocados far outweigh the &ldquo;risks&rdquo;. You can read more about the benefits of avocado here</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>1. The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth for smaller babies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3. In my opinion &amp; experience avocado won't cause any constipation in babies. I feed this puree once a week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4. I don&rsquo;t prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>5. Avocado is filled with omega 3, so it is very healthy for babies.</p>\r\n<p>6. Avocado is easily digestible and makes a great first solid food or weaning food for baby.</p>\r\n<p>7. You can skip adding sugar to this puree if your baby likes it plain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to sterilize baby feeding bowls:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Start by sterilizing the bowls and spoons which you are going to feed your baby. Take the bowl and spoon in a large saucepan, cover it with water and bring them to a boil. Boil it rapidly for 5 mins. Now you can turn the heat off and leave them to stay in the hot water till use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Mashed Avocado:</p>\r\n<p>Take a ripe avocado. It has to be fresh and ripe. Cut them in half and remove the seed.</p>\r\n<p>Use a spoon to scoop the flesh from them.</p>\r\n<p>Now take all the flesh in a bowl and mash it well using a fork or spoon or masher.</p>\r\n<p>You can even put them in a blender and puree them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now add sugar to taste and mix well.</p>\r\n<p>Pour this into sterilized clean bowls and feed your baby.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/18dacc17-e798-42f7-ae05-c352140d6da3_avocado.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"avocado-puree-recipe-for-babies-mashed-avocado-","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1090,"title":"Apple, Pear and Cinnamon Puree Recipe for Babies","imageUrl":"9ef5038b-ebfe-48a2-861a-7d533874d65e_apple.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-02-10T14:30:59.1Z","dateModified":"2020-02-10T14:31:10.374Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Apples and Pears make a portion of great baby food.
