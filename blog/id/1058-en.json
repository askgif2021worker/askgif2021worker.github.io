For babies, it is not recommended to add any raising agents like baking soda or powder. So it is best to go for a shortbread kind of cookies.</p>\r\n<p>One day I thought of making wheat cookies with ghee. First, I thought of adding jaggery in the cookies, but I was confused that if I need to add jaggery it has to be melted and strained. So I was not sure whether that liquid will make a perfect cookie. So I thought of adding panangkarkandu which is also called rock sugar. I added some ginger powder for flavor and the cookies turned out brilliant.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you will give this a try and not only your baby, you too can enjoy this healthy and tasty one.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Preparation Time: 10 mins</p>\r\n<p>Cooking Time: 12 to 14 mins</p>\r\n<p>Makes: 20 Biscuits</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Wheat Flour / Atta &ndash; 1 cup</p>\r\n<p>Rock Sugar / Panangkarkandu &ndash; 1/2 cup Powdered</p>\r\n<p>Ghee &ndash; 1/4 cup</p>\r\n<p>Dry Ginger Powder / Chukku Podi &ndash; 1/2 tsp</p>\r\n<p>Milk &ndash; 2 to 3 tablespoon</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(MY 1 CUP MEASURES 240 ML)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Method:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Preheat oven to 180 degrees C.</p>\r\n<p>Take ghee and sugar in a bowl.
