This makes a great baby food too.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1)The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2)Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3)In my opinion and experience, guava won't cause any constipation in babies. I feed this puree once a week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4) I don&rsquo;t prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>5)Remove the seeds from the guava completely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>6)Cooking the guava before feeding makes digestion easy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to sterilize baby feeding bowls:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Start by sterilizing the bowls and spoons which you are going to feed your baby. Take the bowl and spoon in a large saucepan, cover it with water and bring them to a boil. Boil it rapidly for 5 mins. Now you can turn the heat off and leave them to stay in the hot water till use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Steamed Mashed Banana:</p>\r\n<p>Take ripe guava. It has to be fresh and ripe. Peel them and cut the cheeks of them.</p>\r\n<p>Use a spoon to scoop the seeds from them.</p>\r\n<p>Now take all the flesh in a saucepan, add a splash of water and cover it and simmer for 5 mins or till it is cooked.</p>\r\n<p>Pierce with a knife to see whether it is cooked. If you go in easily then it is cooked.</p>\r\n<p>Put them in a blender and puree them. You can add some clean water to adjust the consistency.</p>\r\n<p>Pour this into sterilized clean bowls and feed your baby.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/f258e238-edd6-42c1-9cfa-d7a5e4b6b0bf_guava.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"guava-puree-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1047,"title":"Babies Curd Rice Recipe - Yogurt Rice Recipe for Kids And Babies","imageUrl":"afda321d-2976-45ed-b728-a14307d378fd_curd-rice.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-01-25T02:46:56.767Z","dateModified":"2020-01-25T02:47:20.059Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"The key to making a tasty and kids friendly curd rice or yogurt rice is to add less yogurt and more milk which makes it tastier.\r\nSo give this a try and let me know how it turns out for you.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPreparation Time: 5 mins\r\nCooking Time: 20 to 30 mins\r\nServes ","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/afda321d-2976-45ed-b728-a14307d378fd_curd-rice.jpg","category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"slug":"babies-curd-rice-recipe-yogurt-rice-recipe-for-kids-and-babies","total":0},{"id":1033,"title":"Mixed Dal and Rice Porridge Mix Recipe For Babies","imageUrl":"6f54fd3a-bc7b-4453-a0e7-2f881c162a80_Mixed-dal.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-01-03T02:33:32.777Z","dateModified":"2020-01-03T02:33:57.073Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Mixed dal and rice porridge mix for babies which is very healthy for them.
