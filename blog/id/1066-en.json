It helps to boost digestion and improves it. It has lots of vitamins A, C &amp; E, rich in beta carotene, fiber, and folic acid. But I would never suggest giving papaya in the early stage.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>1)The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.</p>\r\n<p>2)Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3)In my opinion &amp; experience melons won't cause any constipation in babies.</p>\r\n<p>4) I don't prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day. But if you are busy or find difficult to get time, then freeze it in individual containers and thaw it overnight in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>5)When choosing papaya, choose ripe ones.</p>\r\n<p>6)I suggest feeding this to your baby after their 10th month.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to sterilize baby feeding bowls:</p>\r\n<p>Start by sterilizing the bowls and spoons which you are going to feed your baby. Take the bowl and spoon in a large saucepan, cover it with water and bring them to a boil. Boil it rapidly for 5 mins. Now you can turn the heat off and leave them to stay in the hot water till use.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to Make Papaya Puree:</p>\r\n<p>Take some ripe sweet papaya, peel them, deseed them and cube them. Add them to a blender and make into a fine puree. Pour into a feeding bowl and feed your baby.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/9659b00a-b998-470b-ab6a-41a6605ff2f7_papaya.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"papaya-puree-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1080,"title":"Homemade Health Mix Powder ( Sathu Maavu Mix ) Recipe for Babies","imageUrl":"1b1a950b-2b60-440a-bb47-d0b31f9235c5_sathu.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-02-09T03:26:15.83Z","dateModified":"2020-02-09T03:26:26.873Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"This is a super-duper healthy mix for your baby.
