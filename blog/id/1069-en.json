Now add some roasted cumin and asafoetida and powder them finely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember before making this powder:</p>\r\n<p>1) Make sure you roast the rice and dal well before grinding it.</p>\r\n<p>2) Always make small batches, so the powder stays fresh always.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3) I store the powder in an airtight container in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>4) This porridge can be given for babies who are above 6 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>5) This powder doesn&rsquo;t cause constipation in babies.</p>\r\n<p>6) The consistency of the porridge which you make totally depends on you. You can make it too runnier and pour it bottles and feed your baby or make it a little thicker and feed your baby using a spoon.</p>\r\n<p>7) If you feed a good bowl of this for your baby. Your baby will sleep peacefully for a good 2 to 3 hours. It is that filling.</p>\r\n<p>8)You can add a touch of salt for taste and drizzle some homemade ghee.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to sterilize baby feeding bowls:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Start by sterilizing the bowls and spoons which you are going to feed your baby. Take the bowl and spoon in a large saucepan, cover it with water and bring them to a boil. Boil it rapidly for 5 mins. Now you can turn the heat off and leave them to stay in the hot water till use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Rice &amp; Dal Powder:</p>\r\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\r\n<p>Rice &ndash; 1 cup</p>\r\n<p>Yellow Split Moong Dal / Pasi Paruppu &ndash; 1/4 cup</p>\r\n<p>Masoor Dal &ndash; 1/4 cup</p>\r\n<p>Cumin Seeds &ndash; 1 teaspoon</p>\r\n<p>Asafoetida / Hing / Kaya Podi &ndash; 1/2 teaspoon</p>\r\n<p>Homemade ghee &ndash; 1 teaspoon</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For Making Porridge:</p>\r\n<p>Rice Dal Powder &ndash; 2 tablespoon</p>\r\n<p>Nuts Powder &ndash; 2 tsp</p>\r\n<p>Water &ndash; 3/4 cup</p>\r\n<p>Salt to taste (optional)</p>\r\n<p>Homemade Ghee &ndash; 1 tsp</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Method:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Wash rice and dal in lots of water till it is completely cleaned. Drain it and dry it.</p>\r\n<p>Heat ghee in a thick bottom Kadai. Add in the washed rice and dal and roast them on medium heat till it is golden. It will take around 20 to 25 mins.</p>\r\n<p>Now remove them to a plate and let it cool.</p>\r\n<p>In the same pan roast cumin and asafoetida for a couple of mins and remove them as well.</p>\r\n<p>Now take everything in a blender and powder them finely.</p>\r\n<p>Place a sieve over a place and sieve this mix. You will get some coarse crumbs, add that back in blender and powder again and sieve it again.</p>\r\n<p>Once everything is done, allow the powder to cool and then store it in an airtight container.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I store these in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>When making porridge, I add a couple of tablespoons of this powder and 2 tsp of the nuts powder. I mix them well with 3/4 water and heat it. I cook this on low heat till it is cooked, it will take around 5 mins.</p>\r\n<p>Now remove them from heat and allow it to cool a bit, you can add some salt and some ghee for taste and feed your baby.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/0b0ebacb-604c-4697-b6d9-558dec9b3740_khichdi.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"rice-and-dal-powder-khichdi-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1098,"title":"Mashed Apple Sauce Recipe for Babies","imageUrl":"8c5e5a15-6412-4bca-83b6-c86bf02139ab_apple.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-02-11T04:20:07.893Z","dateModified":"2020-02-11T04:20:18.742Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"If you are planning to start your baby with solid food, I recommend you to start with apples.
