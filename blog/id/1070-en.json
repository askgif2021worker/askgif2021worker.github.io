I have written in detail about spicing your baby's food. In my apple oatmeal recipe, I spiced it with a touch of cinnamon. Now in my pear oatmeal, I added a touch of cardamom and it was yummy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) I used instant oats since that is the only oats available in my place. If you can get steel-cut oats, then they are highly recommended.</p>\r\n<p>2) You could add any fruits in this porridge that your baby loves.</p>\r\n<p>3) Adding cardamom is optional. You can leave it or simply add any other spices like cinnamon.</p>\r\n<p>4) If you are afraid, whether oats/oatmeal cause constipation in babies. In my opinion and experience, oats/oatmeal won't cause constipation.</p>\r\n<p>5) Puree the oats porridge finely or to the texture, you like to feed your baby.</p>\r\n<p>6) If your pear is too sweet and you find your porridge to be sweet enough. Then don't add any sugar. But Maha likes her food a little on the sweeter side, so I added juts a tsp of sugar.</p>\r\n<p>7) I am not feeding oats daily to maha. I give ragi porridge one day, the next day I feed raw banana powder porridge, then the next day i give her oats porridge. So she doesn&rsquo;t feel bored with the same food.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>8) I recommend you to start oatmeal on the 6th month of your baby.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to sterilize baby feeding bowls:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Start by sterilizing the bowls and spoons which you are going to feed your baby. Take the bowl and spoon in a large saucepan, cover it with water and bring them to a boil. Boil it rapidly for 5 mins. Now you can turn the heat off and leave them to stay in the hot water till use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make porridge:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Instant Oats &ndash; 1.5 tablespoon</p>\r\n<p>Pear &ndash; 1/2 a big one</p>\r\n<p>Cardamom Powder &ndash; 1/4 teaspoon</p>\r\n<p>Water &ndash; 1/2 cup or adjust</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Method:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Start by peeling and chopping 1/2 a pear into small pieces.</p>\r\n<p>Take a clean saucepan, in which you cook your baby's food. Add oats, chopped pear, cardamom and clean water in it.</p>\r\n<p>Put the saucepan on the stove and cook it for 3 to 4 mins on a low flame till the oats are completely cooked.</p>\r\n<p>Now take it off the stove and let it cool a bit. Pour the whole mix in a blender and make it into a smooth puree.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pour the porridge on to clean sterilized bowls and feed your baby. You can pour this into a feeding bottle and feed your baby.&nbsp;</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/048a7658-0c04-407a-83a6-de8f2080849f_pear-oats.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"pear-oats-and-cardamom-porridge-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1075,"title":"Healthy Nuts Powder Recipe for Babies","imageUrl":"abb8ac17-ad5d-4c74-b79f-548c66f76240_halthy-nuts.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-02-08T11:45:08.405Z","dateModified":"2020-02-08T11:46:36.357Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"If you want to make this for older babies. just add some Pista, raisins, walnuts, dates to make it more healthy.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis is great as a daily health booster for your babies.
