It is small in size and easy to digest for the baby. You can feed any small variety banana for your baby in their raw form. But nendrapazham which is called as ripe plantain should be steamed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.</p>\r\n<p>2) Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3) In my opinion &amp; experience bananas won't cause any constipation in babies.</p>\r\n<p>4) I don&rsquo;t prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day. But if you are busy or find difficult to get time, then freeze it in individual containers and thaw it overnight in the fridge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to sterilize baby feeding bowls:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Start by sterilizing the bowls and spoons which you are going to feed your baby.
