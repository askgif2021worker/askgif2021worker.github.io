It has so many health benefits, read all of them here. I boil sweet potatoes and feed, but to bring out the maximum sweetness from them, it is best to oven roast them, just slice them in half, wrap them in foil and roast it for 40 to 45 mins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.</p>\r\n<p>2) Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3) In my opinion &amp; experience, sweet potatoes won't cause any constipation in babies. But it may cause gas in some babies. Anyhow, I won't feed this puree daily, I give it twice a week.</p>\r\n<p>4) I don&rsquo;t prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day. But if you are busy or find difficult to get time, then freeze it in individual containers and thaw it overnight in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>5) When choosing sweet potatoes, get firm, red variety and sweet ones.</p>\r\n<p>6) Sweet Potato is less likely to have any allergenic reactions.</p>\r\n<p>7) You can introduce this to your baby after 8 months.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to sterilize baby feeding bowls:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Start by sterilizing the bowls and spoons which you are going to feed your baby. Take the bowl and spoon in a large saucepan, cover it with water and bring them to a boil. Boil it rapidly for 5 mins. Now you can turn the heat off and leave them to stay in the hot water till use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Sweet Potato Puree:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Choose a fresh, firm sweet potato. Wash them well. Peel them slightly. Cube them. Put them in water and wash them well till there is no starch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now transfer them in a saucepan, cover them with clean water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Place it on the stove and bring it to boil.
