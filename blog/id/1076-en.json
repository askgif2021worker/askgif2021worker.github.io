One of my favorite ingredients to have on hand. I love to add it to so many of my curries, especially whenever I make dal I make tempering with ghee, it gives a nice flavor to the dish. I even make these ghee cookies, when I want something sweet. Ghee is such a versatile ingredient and has a long shelf life than butter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This ghee is much more aromatic than your store-bought ones and you will be smelling it all the time. I hope you will like it and let me know if you try it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Preparation Time: 0 mins</p>\r\n<p>Cooking Time: 30 to 40 mins</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Homemade Butter &ndash; 500 grams</p>\r\n<p>Drumstick leaves &ndash;&nbsp; 2 sprigs</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Method:</p>\r\n<p>Take butter in a heavy bottom pan and heat it up on medium heat. Now the butter will melt and the milk solids will separate from it and start to foam up.</p>\r\n<p>Keep on heating, now the foam will subside a little and it will bubble up. The water from the butter will start evaporating and reducing.</p>\r\n<p>Now the milk solid will get toasted and it will get settled at the bottom, leaving a clear golden liquid.</p>\r\n<p>Now add in drumstick leaves and let them crisp up.</p>\r\n<p>Once crisp, turn off the heat and let the ghee gets cool.</p>\r\n<p>Once it is cooled, strain it in an airtight container.</p>\r\n<p>Store at room temp.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Notes:</p>\r\n<p>1) Always cook butter on a low to medium heat to avoid burning.</p>\r\n<p>2) You can use store-bought yellow butter, I used white butter.</p>\r\n<p>3) You can add some salt or curry leaves when u add drumstick leaves.</p>\r\n<p>4) After draining the ghee, we mix the sediments with some cooked rice and enjoy it. It is so tasty.</p>\r\n<p>5) Use thick bottom pan for cooking ghee.</p>\r\n<p>6) Don't use cold butter directly on hot Kadai, it may burn. Use room temperature butter</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/ec8b1224-830c-4cbe-8b0f-532c627c1773_ghee.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"homemade-ghee-clarified-butter-recipe","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1040,"title":"Puffed rice instant cereal Recipe for Babies - Travel Food for Babies","imageUrl":"d957b9c8-db4e-4329-9994-a4b8f830edca_IMG_6313.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-01-24T02:07:30.393Z","dateModified":"2020-01-24T02:08:32.813Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Puffed Rice Instant Cereal for Babies.
