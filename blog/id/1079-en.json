It's all because of laziness. I have a few baby recipes to share, so I decided to post all of them now, so many will get benefited from that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To add more taste to rice, I add a touch of rice and some freshly ground pepper in it. Maha loves it a lot.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) Cook rice properly till it is almost mashed up, which helps in easy digestion in babies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2) Always wash rice very well to remove all the starch and wacky stuff from it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3) Add garlic and asafoetida when cooking rice if you wish This helps in digestion in babies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4) This is so filling and nutritious meal for your babies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>5) You can start feeding this for babies above 6 months. For 6 month baby don't add pepper.</p>\r\n<p>6) Always feed this meal for lunch, not for dinner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>7) The consistency of this is up to you. You can mash them with a potato masher, or put them in a blender and make into a fine puree. I make it into a fine puree.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>8) Adding ghee enhances the flavor and makes it more nutritious for your baby and helps in weight gaining in babies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>9) Make sure the ghee which you use is pure ones. I make my own ghee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>10) Rice won't cause constipation, allergies in babies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to sterilize baby feeding bowls:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Start by sterilizing the bowls and spoons which you are going to feed your baby. Take the bowl and spoon in a large saucepan, cover it with water and bring them to a boil. Boil it rapidly for 5 mins. Now you can turn the heat off and leave them to stay in the hot water till use.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make ghee rice for babies:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rice &ndash; 1/2 cup cooked</p>\r\n<p>Ghee &ndash; 1 teaspoon</p>\r\n<p>Salt a pinch</p>\r\n<p>Freshly Ground Pepper a pinch</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Method:</p>\r\n<p>Take cooked rice in a bowl, mash it well.</p>\r\n<p>Add a spoon of ghee, salt, and pepper and mix well.
