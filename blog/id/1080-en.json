You could buy a decent health powder mix from shops. But I love to make it myself for my baby because you get to know what goes into them and you can customize it as per your baby needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I added rice and pulses in my health mix. So I feed this porridge for my baby for lunch instead of giving rice khichdi. I made two versions of this powder, one savory and one sweet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For making porridge out of it:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>you can mix a couple of tablespoons of this powder with some water and cook it for 10 mins on a very low flame till the rice and dal are cooked. Then you can add some sweetener to sweet one and salt in the savory one. It is that simple.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Preparation Time: 10 mins</p>\r\n<p>Cooking Time: 1 hour</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rice &ndash; 1.5 cup ( I used cooking rice, ponni brand)</p>\r\n<p>Barley &ndash; 1 cup</p>\r\n<p>Roasted Gram Dal / Pori Kadalai / Pottu Kadalai &ndash; 1 cup</p>\r\n<p>Whole Black Urad Dal &ndash; 1 cup</p>\r\n<p>Green Gram Dal &ndash; 1 cup</p>\r\n<p>Yellow Moong Dal / Pasi Paruppu &ndash; 1/2 cup</p>\r\n<p>Masoor Dal &ndash; 1/2 cup</p>\r\n<p>Broken Wheat / Cracked Wheat / Dalia &ndash; 1 cup</p>\r\n<p>Cashew &ndash; 1/2 cup</p>\r\n<p>Badam / Almond &ndash; 1/2 cup</p>\r\n<p>Cumin Seeds / Jeerakam &ndash; 1 teaspoon</p>\r\n<p>Ajwain Seeds / Omam &ndash; 1/2 teaspoon</p>\r\n<p>Cardamom / Yelakai &ndash; 10 pods (If using this, leave ajwain and cumin)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Method:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Take urad dal and green gram in a bowl and wash them well, drain and add to a dry pan and roast till it turns golden brown and dry. Remove to a plate.</p>\r\n<p>Take masoor dal and yellow moong dal in a bowl and wash them well, drain and add to a</p>\r\n<p>dry pan and roast till it turns golden brown and dry. Remove to the same plate.</p>\r\n<p>Take rice and barley in a bowl and wash them well, drain and add to a</p>\r\n<p>dry pan and roast till it turns golden brown and dry. Remove to the same</p>\r\n<p>plate.</p>\r\n<p>Roast roasted gram dal till golden and remove to the same plate.</p>\r\n<p>Roast Dalia till golden and remove to the same plate.</p>\r\n<p>Roast cashews and almonds till golden and remove to the same plate.</p>\r\n<p>Roast cumin and ajwain till golden and remove to the same plate. If you are making a sweet one, leave ajwain and cumin and add cardamom to it.</p>\r\n<p>I made two versions, so I took half of the mix and added cardamom to one and roasted cumin and ajwain in another. Now grind them in a mixer and sieve it.</p>\r\n<p>Store in an airtight container.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/1b1a950b-2b60-440a-bb47-d0b31f9235c5_sathu.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"homemade-health-mix-powder-sathu-maavu-mix-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1084,"title":"Pear ( Sauce ) Puree Recipe for Babies","imageUrl":"e40ac071-01e3-4539-8b77-40dbcb5fd1df_pear-puree.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-02-09T06:56:35.855Z","dateModified":"2020-02-09T06:57:25.45Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Pears make great baby food.
