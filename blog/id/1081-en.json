So much healthier one. Since it is filled with spinach. Spinach is filled with iron, so it is much more nutritious for your baby. You can add any spinach in this, I used arai keerai.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember before making this</p>\r\n<p>1) Cook rice and dal properly till it is almost mashed up, which helps in easy digestion in babies.</p>\r\n<p>2) Always wash rice, dal, and spinach very well to remove all the starch and wacky stuff from it.</p>\r\n<p>3) Add garlic and asafoetida helps in digestion in babies.</p>\r\n<p>4) This khichdi is so filling and nutritious meal for your babies.</p>\r\n<p>5) You can start feeding this for babies above 6 months.</p>\r\n<p>6) Always feed this meal for lunch, not for dinner.</p>\r\n<p>7) The consistency of this is up to you. You can mash them with a potato masher, or put them in a blender and make into a fine puree. I make it into a fine puree.</p>\r\n<p>8) Adding ghee enhances the flavor and makes it more nutritious for your baby and helps in weight gaining in babies.</p>\r\n<p>9) Make sure the ghee which you use is pure ones. I make my own ghee.</p>\r\n<p>10) Rice won't cause constipation, allergies in babies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Rice &amp; Dal Khichdi:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rice &ndash; 3 tablespoon</p>\r\n<p>Yellow Moong Dal / Pasi Paruppu &ndash; 3 tablespoon</p>\r\n<p>Spinach Leaves &ndash;&nbsp; Two handfuls</p>\r\n<p>Garlic &ndash; 6 cloves</p>\r\n<p>Asafoetida / Hing / Kaya Podi &ndash; a pinch</p>\r\n<p>Salt to taste</p>\r\n<p>Homemade Ghee &ndash; 1 tablespoon</p>\r\n<p>Water &ndash; 1 1/2 cup</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Method:</p>\r\n<p>Take rice and dal in a bowl and wash it well.
