Adding dal into rice makes it more wholesome and provides the protein which your baby needs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember before making this</p>\r\n<p>1) Cook rice and dal properly till it is almost mashed up, which helps in easy digestion in babies.</p>\r\n<p>2) Always wash rice and dal very well to remove all the starch and wacky stuff from it.</p>\r\n<p>3) Add garlic, cumin and asafoetida help in digestion in babies.</p>\r\n<p>4) This khichdi is so filling and nutritious meal for your babies.</p>\r\n<p>5) You can start feeding this for babies above 6 months.</p>\r\n<p>6) Always feed this meal for lunch, not for dinner.</p>\r\n<p>7) The consistency of this is up to you.

I make it into a fine puree.</p>\r\n<p>8) Adding ghee enhances the flavor and makes it more nutritious for your baby and helps in weight gaining in babies.</p>\r\n<p>9) Make sure the ghee which you use is pure ones.
