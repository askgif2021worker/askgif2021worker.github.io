It is so easy to prepare and so healthy for babies too. There are certain things you have to read must before making this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember before making this:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) Roast sooji well in the ghee this makes it easy to digest in babies.</p>\r\n<p>2) You can roast sooji in bulk and store it in an airtight container in the fridge and use it accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>3) If you want a finer and smooth kheer, powder the roasted sooji in a blender, this will make smoother kheer and your baby will find it easy to swallow. I make it that way only. The texture depends upon your baby's interest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4) For babies above 1-year-old, you can make this kheer with cow&rsquo;s milk, for babies below 1-year cow&rsquo;s milk is not advisable.</p>\r\n<p>5) Don't add formula milk to hot kheer since formula milk should not be cooked, let the kheer comes to a warm temp in which you feed your baby, then add the prepared formula milk.</p>\r\n<p>6) I use panakarkandu or karupatti as a sweetener. Karupatti strengthens your baby bones. Panakarkandu helps to prevent cold for your babies. You can even mix up a small piece of both.</p>\r\n<p>7) If you feed a good bowl of this for your baby. Your baby will sleep peacefully for a good 2 to 3 hours. It is that filling.</p>\r\n<p>8) Sooji doesn&rsquo;t cause constipation in babies.</p>\r\n<p>9) Sooji is easy to digest and non-allergenic food.</p>\r\n<p>10)The consistency of the porridge which you make totally depends on you. You can make it too runnier and pour it bottles and feed your baby or make it a little thicker and feed your baby using a spoon.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Sooji Kheer for Babies &amp; Infants :</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ingredients:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sooji / Semolina / Suji / Rava &ndash; 2 tablespoon</p>\r\n<p>Jaggery /Sarkarai / Vellam / Palmsugar &ndash; 2 tablespoon</p>\r\n<p>Clean Water &ndash; 1 cup</p>\r\n<p>Ghee &ndash; 1 tsp</p>\r\n<p>Formula Milk &ndash; 1/4 cup (Use cow&rsquo;s milk for babies above 1 year)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(I use lactogen for my baby)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Method:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Take a clean saucepan and add in a tsp of ghee.
