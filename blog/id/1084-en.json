I give apple puree one day, pear puree the next day and I mix them and make apple pear puree and feed her. I also add a dash of cinnamon to spice it up. Check out my detail post about spicing baby foods. Pear makes great first food for babies since it is less allergenic and it easily digests. Your baby will love it for sure.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.</p>\r\n<p>2) Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3) In my opinion and experience, pears won't cause any constipation in babies.</p>\r\n<p>4) I don&rsquo;t prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day. But if you are busy or find difficult to get time, then freeze it in individual containers and thaw it overnight in the fridge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Pear Puree:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Take a firm fresh and sweet pear.
