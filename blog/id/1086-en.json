For a variation, I added some beetroots in the puree as well. So it is more healthy and nutritious. Beetroots have not only the amazing color, but it is also rich in antioxidants, folate, manganese, potassium, vitamin -A and many other properties. So it is good for your babies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2) Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3) In my opinion &amp; experience potatoes won't cause any constipation in babies. But it may cause gas in some babies. Anyhow, I won't feed this puree daily, I give it thrice a week.</p>\r\n<p>4) I don&rsquo;t prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day. But if you are busy or find difficult to get time, then freeze it in individual containers and thaw it overnight in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>5)When choosing potatoes, get firm, white variety. And carrots and beets should be sweet and firm.</p>\r\n<p>6)Potato, carrots, and beets are less likely to have any allergenic reactions.</p>\r\n<p>7)After having this puree, your baby's poop will be red in color. don't panic seeing that, it is because of the beets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Carrot, Beetroot &amp; Potato Puree:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Choose a fresh, firm potato, beetroot and carrot. Wash them well. Peel them slightly. Cube them. Put them in water and wash them well till there is no starch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now transfer them in a saucepan, cover them with clean water.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Place it on the stove and bring it to boil. Cover it and simmer it. Cook for 12 to 15 mins till the veggies are completely cooked.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now drain the veggies to a bowl or a mixer. Reserve the cooking liquid.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can puree them in a blender or use a hand-blender. Use the reserved liquid to thin the puree if needed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Transfer this to a bowl and feed your baby with a spoon.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/59ee06f5-3f03-468c-9976-b0371634dd38_carrot.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"potato-carrot-and-beetroot-puree-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1083,"title":"Sooji ( Rava ) Kheer Recipe for Babies","imageUrl":"f24a1f5a-597b-4238-8734-094ae1b62ff4_kheer.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-02-09T06:38:51.452Z","dateModified":"2020-02-09T06:42:35.721Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"When your baby gets bored to the usual ragi porridge, raw banana porridge, and wheat porridge, then this sooji porridge comes as a lifesaver.
