Maha loves sweet porridge, you can make this salty too. I will share that recipe soon. This is so filling and healthy since it has all good stuff in it. This porridge will be a different food from the usual ragi porridge or banana porridge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Few things you have to remember before making this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1)The consistency of the porridge which you make totally depends on you. You can make it too runnier and pour it bottles and feed your baby or make it a little thicker and feed your baby using a spoon.</p>\r\n<p>2) I use panakarkandu or karupatti as sweetener. Karupatti strengthens your baby bones. Panakarkandu helps to prevent cold for your babies. You can even mix up a small piece of both.</p>\r\n<p>3)If you feed a good bowl of this for your baby. Your baby will sleep peacefully for a good 2 to 3 hours. It is that filling.</p>\r\n<p>4)This won't cause constipation in babies. I am feeding this every alternate day to maha and she is passing stool daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Wheat, Moong Dal &amp; Almond Health Powder:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Take a clean saucepan, add in 2 tablespoon of karupatti / Jaggery / Palm Sugar. Now pour in 3/4 cup of</p>\r\n<p>clean water. Heat this up and cook until the karupatti is melted.</p>\r\n<p>Now take a clean bowl and add 2 scoops of Wheat Health Powder. Add some clean water and mix it up till smooth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now place a fine-mesh strainer over the bowl and Sieve the karupatti liquid through this. Mix this well.</p>\r\n<p>I washed the saucepan in the meantime. Now pour this liquid again in the saucepan.</p>\r\n<p>Heat this on a low flame stirring continuously. Cook this for around 8 mins till the dal and wheat are cooked and thicken.</p>\r\n<p>Take it off the heat, allow it to cool down and transfer it to a feeding bowl or feeding bottle and feed your baby.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/f9e73904-5e56-4d52-9b15-0b61fddb6204_porridge.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"protein-rich-food-wheat-moong-dal-and-almond-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1072,"title":"Sweet Potato ( Mashed ) Puree Recipe for Babies","imageUrl":"247367c5-3186-4b72-93c4-0e9b99104ce3_sweet-potato.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-02-08T05:25:11.877Z","dateModified":"2020-02-08T05:31:32.699Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Sweet Potatoes are such wholesome food to give for babies.
