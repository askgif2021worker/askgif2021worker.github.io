And the addition of almonds makes it super healthy. I used wheat powder in this recipe, my mom buys whole wheat, wash it, dry it in sun and grind it in the mill, I used that homemade powder for this recipe. If you can find good wheat powder you can use that. Or get whole wheat and do what my mom did.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember before making this powder:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) Make sure you roast all the stuff really well before grinding it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2) Always make small batches, so the powder stays fresh always.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3) You can store the powder in an airtight container in the fridge too. I always store homemade powders in the fridge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4) This porridge can be given for babies who are above 6 months.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>5) This wheat powder doesn&rsquo;t cause constipation in babies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>6) The consistency of the porridge which you make totally depends on you. You can make it too runnier and pour it bottles and feed your baby or make it a little thicker and feed your baby using a spoon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>7) I use panakarkandu or karupatti as a sweetener. Karupatti strengthens your baby bones. Panakarkandu helps to prevent cold for your babies. You can even mix up a small piece of both.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>8) If you feed a good bowl of this for your baby. Your baby will sleep peacefully for a good 2 to 3 hours. It is that filling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>9) Instead of Almonds, you can use cashews too or a mixture of both.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to introduce solid food to your baby:</p>\r\n<p>How to make Wheat, Moongdal &amp; Almond Porridge:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Whole Wheat flour &ndash; 1 cup</p>\r\n<p>Yellow Split Moong Dal / Pasi Paruppu &ndash; 1/2 cup</p>\r\n<p>Almonds / Badam &ndash; 1/4 cup</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Method:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Wash moong dal well in lots of water, let it drain in a sieve for 10 to 15 mins.</p>\r\n<p>Heat a heavy bottom Kadai. Add moong dal in it and roast it on medium heat. The moisture will evaporate and the dal will get golden. It will take around 10 to 15 mins. Once it reaches that stage removes to a plate.</p>\r\n<p>Now in the same Kadai roast almonds till they turn golden. It will take around 5 mins. Remove that to the same plate as well.</p>\r\n<p>Now in the same Kadai add in whole wheat flour and roast them on very low heat till nice aroma comes from it. It will take around 5 mins.</p>\r\n<p>Now take the moong dal and almonds in a blender and make it into a smooth powder. Add that powder to the wheat flour and mix well.</p>\r\n<p>Spread them on a plate to cool down. You can see them also.</p>\r\n<p>Store this in an airtight container in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>For Making Porridge out of this powder, Check this.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/b8707c31-ba5c-4792-aa4f-29804e07b5c0_healthy1.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"health-powder-mix-wheat-moong-dal-and-almond-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1092,"title":"Carrot and Potato Puree Recipe for Babies","imageUrl":"3e65e2a0-af5d-4fe5-87d1-ffff9b8a04d3_carrot.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-02-10T14:52:49.233Z","dateModified":"2020-02-10T14:53:04.764Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"I have been sharing veg and fruit purees, porridges, health powders for babies till now.\r\nNow coming to today&rsquo;s recipe.
