In our place, we get a type of banana called as &ldquo;matti pazham&ldquo;. It will small in size and smells so sweet. We mash them up and feed babies. You don't have to steam them. It is really good for babies. But I have heard that you cannot find it in many places. But I am sure that nendran pazham is easily available in all places. And it makes great baby food. But I prefer to steam it and feed baby, so it is easily digestible. Plus it is a great food for weight gaining in babies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.</p>\r\n<p>2) Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3) In my opinion &amp; experience banana won't cause any constipation in babies. I feed this banana puree thrice a week.</p>\r\n<p>4) I don&rsquo;t prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day.</p>\r\n<p>5) Ripe Bananas are less likely to have any allergenic reactions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>6) Use ripe banana for this, it will taste good and is easily digestible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Steamed Mashed Banana:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Take a ripe banana (nendrapazham). It has to be fresh and ripe. Cut it in half and place it on a steamer plate.</p>\r\n<p>Place the plate on the steamer and cover it. Steam for a good 10 to 12 mins.</p>\r\n<p>Pierce with a knife to see whether it is cooked.
