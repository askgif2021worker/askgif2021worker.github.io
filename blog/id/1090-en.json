I give apple puree one day, pear puree(recipe soon) the next day. Then I mix them up and feed her. I also add a dash of cinnamon to spice it up. Check out my detail post about spicing baby foods.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.</p>\r\n<p>2) Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3) In my opinion and experience, pears and apple won't cause any constipation in babies.</p>\r\n<p>4) I don&rsquo;t prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day. But if you are busy or find difficult to get time, then freeze it in individual containers and thaw it overnight in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>5) Apple and pear are less likely to have any allergenic reactions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Apple, Pear &amp; Cinnamon Puree:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Take half an apple and half a pear.
