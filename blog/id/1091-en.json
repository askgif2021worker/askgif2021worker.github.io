So make sure you read the complete recipe.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Few things you have to remember before making this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) The consistency of the porridge which you make totally depends on you. You can make it too runnier and pour it bottles and feed your baby or make it a little thicker and feed your baby using a spoon.</p>\r\n<p>2) If you feed a good bowl of this for your baby. Your baby will sleep peacefully for a good 2 hours. It is that filling.</p>\r\n<p>3) This won't cause constipation in babies.
