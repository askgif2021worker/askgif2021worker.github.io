Potatoes are usually bland by their nature. So I love to add other sweet veggies to it to make it tastier for babies. Normally I add some sweet carrots to it, I even add a piece of beetroots too. Potatoes make this puree more creamy and carrots add a natural sweetness to this puree too.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>1) The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2) Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3) In my opinion &amp; experience potatoes won't cause any constipation in babies. But it may cause gas in some babies. Anyhow, I won't feed this puree daily, I give it two times a week.</p>\r\n<p>4) I don&rsquo;t prefer freezing purees. I make it fresh every day. But if you are busy or find difficult to get time, then freeze it in individual containers and thaw it overnight in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>5) When choosing potatoes, get firm, white variety.</p>\r\n<p>6) Potato and carrots are less likely to have any allergenic reactions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Carrot &amp; Potato Puree:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Choose a fresh, firm potato and carrot. Wash them well. Peel them slightly. Cube them. Put them in water and wash them well till there is no starch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now transfer them in a saucepan, cover them with clean water.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Place it on the stove and bring it to boil. Cover it and simmer it. Cook for 12 to 15 mins till the veggies are completely cooked.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now drain the veggies to a bowl or a mixer. Reserve the cooking liquid.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can puree them in a blender or use a hand-blender. Use the reserved liquid to thin the puree if needed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Transfer this to a bowl and feed your baby with a spoon.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/3e65e2a0-af5d-4fe5-87d1-ffff9b8a04d3_carrot.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"carrot-and-potato-puree-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1054,"title":"Eggless Nutella, French Toast Sticks Recipe ( Egg Option is also Included)","imageUrl":"4a9530d2-7d55-4449-8cdd-6908a9f2da97_nutella.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-01-27T02:16:12.133Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T02:17:37.277Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"I spread some Nutella over the bread and coated it with an eggless custard mix and fried it.
