But it was difficult to find time to post it, finally, I managed to get banana powder recipe and banana porridge recipe up at the same time.</p>\r\n<p>This powder is so healthy, it helps in healthy weight gaining in your babies. Normally we feed ragi porridge for babies, and I am sure that babies will get bored because of the same food. So in order to make their food interesting and different, you can follow what I normally do.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Few things you have to remember before making this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) The consistency of the porridge which you make totally depends on you. You can make it too runnier and pour it bottles and feed your baby or make it a little thicker and feed your baby using a spoon.</p>\r\n<p>2) I use panakarkandu or karupatti as sweetener. Karupatti strengthens your baby bones. Panakarkandu helps to prevent cold for your babies. You can even mix up a small piece of both.</p>\r\n<p>3) If you feed a good bowl of this for your baby. Your baby will sleep peacefully for a good 2 to 3 hours. It is that filling.</p>\r\n<p>4) This won't cause constipation in babies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Raw Banana Porridge:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Take a clean saucepan, add in 2 tablespoons of karupatti. Now pour in 3/4 cup of clean water. Heat this up and cook until the karupatti is melted.</p>\r\n<p>Now take a clean bowl and add 2 scoops of banana powder. Add some clean water and mix it up till smooth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now place a fine-mesh strainer over the bowl and Sieve the karupatti liquid through this. Mix this well.</p>\r\n<p>I washed the saucepan in the meantime. Now pour this liquid again in the saucepan.</p>\r\n<p>Heat this on a low flame stirring continuously. Cook this for around 2 mins till the banana is cooked and thicken.</p>\r\n<p>Take it off the heat, allow it to cool down and transfer it to a feeding bowl or feeding bottle and feed your baby.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/28f19730-a42d-487e-9f29-cee4a5dde2b0_banana.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"raw-banana-porridge-weight-gaining-recipes-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1074,"title":"Muskmelon ( Cantaloupe ) Puree Recipe For Babies","imageUrl":"d7eda6b7-2091-4eaf-87e3-fb4fefa48a53_muskmelon.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-02-08T11:31:59.88Z","dateModified":"2020-02-08T11:32:32.007Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Melons are such a wonder food for your babies during hot summer days.
