Oats are a very healthy grain and make a portion of great first food for your babies.&nbsp; A few days back, I decided to make oats porridge, to make it more healthy and tastier I added some apples in it. I added some clean cinnamon powder which I bought during my last visit to Chennai in nuts &amp; spices shop. To my surprise she loved it. Cinnamon not only gives a lovely aroma to the porridge, but it also helps indigestion.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>1) I used instant oats since that is the only oats available in my place. If you can get steel-cut oats, then they are highly recommended.</p>\r\n<p>2) You could add any fruits in this porridge that your baby loves.</p>\r\n<p>3) Adding cinnamon is optional. You can leave it or simply add any other spices like cardamom,</p>\r\n<p>4) If you are afraid, whether oats/oatmeal cause constipation in babies. In my opinion and experience, oats/oatmeal won't cause constipation.</p>\r\n<p>5) Puree the oats porridge finely or to the texture, you like to feed your baby.</p>\r\n<p>6) If your apples are too sweet and you find your porridge to be sweet enough. Then don't add any sugar.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>7) I am not feeding oats daily to maha. I give ragi porridge one day, the next day I feed raw banana powder porridge(recipe soon), then the next day I give her oats porridge. So she doesn&rsquo;t feel bored with the same food.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>8) I recommend you to start oatmeal on the 6th month of your baby.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make porridge:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Oats &ndash; 1.5 tablespoon</p>\r\n<p>Apple &ndash; 1/2 a big apple</p>\r\n<p>Cinnamon Powder &ndash; 1/4 tsp</p>\r\n<p>Water &ndash; 1/2 cup or adjust</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Method:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Start by peeling and chopping 1/2 an apple into small pieces.</p>\r\n<p>Take a clean saucepan, in which you cook your baby's food. Add oats, chopped apple, cinnamon and clean water in it.</p>\r\n<p>Put the saucepan on the stove and cook it for 3 to 4 mins on a low flame till the oats are completely cooked.</p>\r\n<p>Now take it off the stove and let it cool a bit. Pour the whole mix in a blender and make it into a smooth puree.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pour the porridge on to clean sterilized bowls and feed your baby. You</p>\r\n<p>can pour this into a feeding bottle and feed your baby. I cut a bigger</p>\r\n<p>hole in my feeding bottle nipple and feed my baby, this way it is easy</p>\r\n<p>and convenient.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/00a6ae8b-5fa8-45b1-88eb-77846eb6a8a9_apple.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"homemade-apple-oats-and-cinnamon-cereal-porridge-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1033,"title":"Mixed Dal and Rice Porridge Mix Recipe For Babies","imageUrl":"6f54fd3a-bc7b-4453-a0e7-2f881c162a80_Mixed-dal.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-01-03T02:33:32.777Z","dateModified":"2020-01-03T02:33:57.073Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Mixed dal and rice porridge mix for babies which is very healthy for them.
