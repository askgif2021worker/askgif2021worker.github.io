Carrots are rich in Beta Carotene and have tons of Vitamins. Since the veggie is sweet, babies love it so much.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\r\n<p>1) The texture of the puree depends upon you, I would recommend you to make the puree smooth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2) Your baby won't empty the whole bowl all at once, start with few spoons then increase it gradually as days pass by.</p>\r\n<p>3) In my opinion &amp; experience carrots won't cause any constipation in babies.</p>\r\n<p>4) I don't prefer freezing carrot purees. I make it fresh every day. But if you are busy or find difficult to get time, then freeze it in individual containers and thaw it overnight in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>5) When choosing carrot, get bright colored firm ones.</p>\r\n<p>6) Carrots are less likely to have any allergenic reactions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to make Carrot Puree:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Take a firm and sweet carrot. Wash it well in water. You can start with a small to medium size carrot. Cut them finely and add them to a clean bowl.</p>\r\n<p>Now place this in a steamer or do what I do. I heat a pan with water and place a small separator at the bottom of the pan. Then keep the bowl over the separator(which comes with your pressure cooker) and cover the pan and steam for a good 10 to 12 mins till the carrot is cooked.</p>\r\n<p>While the carrots are cooking, you can make the sweetener. You could add some sugar to your baby. But I prefer adding some panakarkandu. I take some panakarkandu and cover it with some water. Heat it so the karkandu dissolves. Now strain this and transfer it to a clean airtight container. You can store this in the fridge and use it whenever you need it. I make this and keep it for 2 to 3 days in the fridge.</p>\r\n<p>When the carrots are done, transfer the carrots to a blender. Add some of the panakarkandu juice and puree them till smooth.</p>\r\n<p>Now pour this into a sterilized bowl and feed your baby. You can pour this into a feeding bottle and feed your baby. I cut a bigger hole in my feeding bottle nipple and feed my baby, this way it is easy and convenient.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/5e8c4705-57aa-44e3-8094-43044c58ef5c_carrot.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"carrot-puree-recipe-for-toddlers-and-kids","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1069,"title":"Rice And Dal Powder ( Khichdi ) Recipe for Babies","imageUrl":"0b0ebacb-604c-4697-b6d9-558dec9b3740_khichdi.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-02-08T03:39:44.813Z","dateModified":"2020-02-08T03:39:56.039Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"This is just roasting dal and rice in a tsp of ghee for quite a long time till it is golden and toasted.
