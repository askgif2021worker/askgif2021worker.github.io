Because apples are non-allergenic fruits and there are packed with tons of nutrients which is a perfect fruit to include in your baby's diet. So my first baby food recipe is going to be apple puree, also known as apple sauce.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to do apple puree:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1) Take a nice, firm, sweet, juicy apple. Cut a small piece of apple from it and place it inside a bowl.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2) Take a pressure cooker and fill the bottom with some water. Now place that bowl inside a pressure cooker.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3) Cover the cooker and cook it for 8 to 10 whistles. Switch off the heat and let the steam escape all by itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4) Open the cooker and remove the bowl carefully. If there is any water inside the bowl, drain that. Allow the apple to cool a bit so you can handle it.</p>\r\n<p>5) Now peel the skin of the apple, since the apple is cooked, the skin just peels off.</p>\r\n<p>6) Now You have two options to make apple puree. you could either mash the apple well with a spoon, add a splash of water if you wish. Keep mashing till the apple is completely mashed up. This type of mashing the apple with a spoon gives a little chunky apple puree and gives the puree some texture or If you want a smooth puree, put the cooked apples in a mixer and puree it. This will give you a smooth puree.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now pour the prepared apple sauce in the sterilized bowl, the easy part is done. Now it is your talent to feed this to your fussy baby.&nbsp;</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/8c5e5a15-6412-4bca-83b6-c86bf02139ab_apple.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"recipe","slug":"recipe"},"slug":"mashed-apple-sauce-recipe-for-babies","tags":[{"name":"baby-food","slug":"baby-food"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1050,"title":"Egg Noodles for Kids and Toddlers","imageUrl":"50342c39-940c-4a45-af85-44b9477de103_egg-noodles.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-01-25T03:59:37.182Z","dateModified":"2020-01-25T03:59:58.586Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"This recipe is very easy to make and taste so yummy.
