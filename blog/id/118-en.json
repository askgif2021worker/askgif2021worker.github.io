Basti district is a part of Basti division. It is situated 202 kilometres east of state capital Lucknow.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Basti was originally known as Vaishishthi town. The origin of the name Vaishishthi is attributed to the fact that this area was the Ashram of Rishi (sage) Vashistha in ancient period. Lord rama with his younger brother laxman had been here for some time with rishi vasistha.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The tract comprising the present district was remote and much of it was covered with forest. But gradually the area became inhabitable, for want of recorded and reliable history it cannot, with any degree of certainty, be said how the district came to be known by its present name on account of the original habitation (Basti) having been selected by the Kalhan Raja as a seat of his Raj, an event which probably occurred in the 16th century. In 1801, Basti became the Tehsil headquarters and in 1865 it was chosen as the headquarters of the newly established district.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the freedom struggle of 1857, about 250 martyrs of Amorha State were hanged by the British Government from peepal trees located at Chhawani.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Education</p>\r\n<p>The district follows a usual 10+2+3 pattern of education as elsewhere in India.
