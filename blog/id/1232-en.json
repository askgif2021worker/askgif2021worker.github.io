Montagnier alleged that an &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; accident was said to have taken place in the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, which specialises in these coronaviruses since early 2000s.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">His allegation has come at a time when the US has started a probe into such reports of virus &ldquo;leak&rdquo;. In fact, US President Donald Trump had a few days ago said, &ldquo;More and more, we&rsquo;re hearing the story&rdquo; and that the US was &ldquo;doing a very thorough investigation&rdquo;. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing a full investigation of everything we can to learn how it is the case that this virus got away, got out into the world and now has created so much tragedy &mdash; so much death &mdash; here in the US and all around the world.&rdquo; He said the US knew that the Wuhan lab &ldquo;contained highly contagious materials&rdquo;.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">The Centre said the Covid-19 situation is \"especially serious\" in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata and a few other places in West Bengal, and violation of lockdown measures risk the spread of the novel coronavirus. The ministry said there have been several incidents of violence against healthcare professionals and complete violation of social distancing norms.</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">Covid-19: Centre objects to Kerala easing lockdown restrictions</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">The home ministry has taken strong objection to the Kerala govt's decision to allow the opening of restaurants, bus travel in cities and opening of MSME industries in municipal areas, saying it amounts to dilution of its lockdown guidelines. Kerala on Sunday reported 2 cases of Covid-19 in the state, taking the total number of affected to 401 while 13 people were cured.</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">Looking into reports that coronavirus 'escaped' from Wuhan lab: Trump</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">Montagnier, however, is a controversial figure as he had earlier published two controversial research studies &mdash; electromagnetic waves emitted by DNA (DNA teleportation) and on the benefits of papaya in AIDS or Parkinson cure &mdash; that attracted criticism from a section of the scientific community.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">Another French virologist &Eacute;tienne Simon-Lori&egrave;re of the Institut Pasteur in Paris, however, rubbished Montagnier&rsquo;s claims. &ldquo;That (His claims) does not make sense. These are very small elements that we find in other viruses of the same family, other coronaviruses in nature,&rdquo; &Eacute;tienne told AFP.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">The theory that the Covid-19 originated from genetic manipulation has been circulating in social media for quite some time. However, China has refuted allegations that the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan laboratory. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian cited the World Health Organisation chief and other unidentified medical experts as saying that there was no evidence that transmission began from the laboratory and there was &ldquo;no scientific basis&rdquo; for such claims.</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"_3WlLe clearfix  \">source: <a title=\"TOI Source\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coronavirus-man-made-in-wuhan-lab-nobel-laureate/articleshow/75227989.cms?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TOI&amp;utm_content=om-bm&amp;from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TOI Source</a></div>\r\n</div>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/9bccf733-e993-4bf0-9516-022775c5c224_research-lab-ap.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"slug":"coronavirus-man-made-in-wuhan-lab-nobel-laureate","tags":[{"name":"covid-19","slug":"covid-19"},{"name":"coronavirus","slug":"coronavirus"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1382,"title":"Glenmark's FabiFlu approved for coronavirus treatment in India, costs Rs 103 per tablet","imageUrl":"8259cd0d-8466-4469-b69e-9624afa974de-fabiflu-glenmarkjpg-1592675731.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-06-20T18:16:31.31Z","dateModified":"2020-06-20T18:16:54.571Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Mumbai-based Glenmark Pharmaceuticals have launched a new antiviral drug - Favipiravir with brand name FabiFlu - for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 patients.
