He was considered to be \"one of the smartest men in South India at the time\" and was an ace in mathematics.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>During British rule, Govindachar would be requested by British lords to help them drawing maps and measuring their lands accurately and would also count and manage the distribution of taxes. In return for the help, Govindachar would get lands from the lords in different parts of Andhra Pradesh.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Govindachar then took those lands and traded those lands for one big 1000 acre land called Uravakonda. He then brought villagers and developed the town by agriculture and building a clock tower. He also made good links with Anantpur and other neighboring towns.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At present, the government owns Uravakonda but the descendants of Govindachar are still alive.
