Buddha statue sankasia","SubTitleHindi":null,"SubContent":"<p>It was at Sankassa that (according to the commentaries) the Buddha returned to earth, after preaching the Abhidhamma Pitaka in Tavatimsa, following the performance of the Twin Miracle under the Gandamba tree. As the time approached for the Buddha to leave T&aacute;vatimsa, Moggallana (Anuruddha, according to Sutta NipƒÅta Commentary ii 570) announced his coming return to the multitude, who had been waiting at Savatthi, fed by Culla Anathapindika, while Moggallana expounded the Dhamma. They then made their way to Sankassa. The descent of the Buddha took place on the day of the Mahapavarana festival. Sakka provides three ladders for the Buddha's descent from Sineru to the earth: on the right was a ladder of gold for the gods; on the left a silver ladder for Maha Brahma and his retinue; and in the middle a ladder of jewels for the Buddha. The assembled people covered the earth for thirty leagues round. There was a clear view of the nine Brahma worlds above and of Avici (a hell) below. The Buddha was accompanied by Pa&ntilde;casikha, M&aacute;tali, Mah&aacute; Brahm&aacute; and Suy&aacute;ma. Sariputta was the first to welcome him (followed by Uppalavanna, and the Buddha preached the Law, starting with what was within the comprehension even of a puthujjana, and ending with what only a Buddha could understand.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On this occasion was preached the Parosahassa J&aacute;taka to proclaim to the multitude the unparalleled wisdom of S&aacute;riputta. It is said that the Buddha's descent to Sankassa had provided opportunity for Moggall&aacute;na to show his eminence in iddhi, Anuruddha in dibbacakkhu, and Punna in skill in preaching, and the Buddha wished to give Sariputta a chance of shining in his wisdom. He therefore asked of S&aacute;riputta questions which no one else could answer. The opening words of the S&aacute;riputta Sutta are supposed to refer to this descent from Tusita.</p>\r\n<p>source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankassa</p>","SubContentHindi":null,"ImageUrl":"ed85d991-6f09-403f-8277-99968600751a_Buddha-statue.jpg","HdImageUrl":null,"gifUrl":null,"Priority":"4"},{"SubTitle":"5.
