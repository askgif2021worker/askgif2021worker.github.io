We have now managed to get our hands on what all entailed during the course of the questioning through sources. Confirming the rumors that were going around, Rhea said that she had been living in with Sushant and that they were looking for a property together as they planned on getting married in November. The actress&rsquo;s entire phone was scanned, along with pictures and videos of them, texts exchanged, and so on. When the cops asked her about their alleged breakup days before Sushant&rsquo;s suicide, the actress revealed that she had indeed left the Carter Road penthouse they shared amid lockdown after getting into a fight. Sources then added that Rhea, however, maintained they kept in touch on phone and texts even after the fight, while showing it to authorities. Rhea happened to be the last person the actor called before going to sleep.</p>\r\n<p>source:&nbsp;https://askblog.page.link/E5rk</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/dcf5715f-c41c-4839-9172-45a84d8c339b-sushant.jpeg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"slug":"sushant-singh-rajput-suicide-case-mumbai-police-grill-rhea-chakraborty-for-almost-9-hours-actress-confesses-she-had-a-fight-with-sushant","tags":[{"name":"india","slug":"india"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1435,"title":"Ex-Union Minister Jaswant Singh Dies At 82.Saddened By Demise,Says PM","imageUrl":"icon_4c223dbc-d8d8-4698-915c-d352a468fdd5.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-09-27T07:55:19.566Z","dateModified":"2020-09-27T07:55:42.134Z","contributedBy":"sumitc91","content":"Jaswant Singh, who was from Rajasthan, had served as India's foreign minister, defense minister and finance minister.\nFormer union minister Jaswant Singh, a close aide of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, died this morning in Delhi.
