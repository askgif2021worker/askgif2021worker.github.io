Now, it seems a fan of the actor has filed a complaint in Bihar's Muzaffarpur against Rhea. The case, which has been registered under sections 420 and 306, will be heard in June 24. As per a report, the fan claims that Sushant was in depression and Rhea instigated him into taking the drastic step. On the other hand, amid the raging debate on nepotism in Bollywood brought on by Sushant Singh Rajput's demise, now, Salman Khan, whom, the actor's fans allege is one of the main players in the power dynamics in the industry, has something important to say. Taking to Twitter, the superstar urged his fans to 'support Sushant's fans n not to go by the language n the curses used but to go with the emotion behind it.' He further asked them to stand by and support his family and fans as the loss of a loved one is extremely painful.</p>\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;https://askblog.page.link/Mfmr</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/b00a492c-d63b-4397-9d0e-cd1a1e6b92ca-76492557.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"slug":"case-filed-against-sushant-singh-rajputs-girlfriend-rhea-chakraborty-salman-khan-appeals-his-fans-to-support-sushants-fans-and-more","tags":[{"name":"india","slug":"india"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1368,"title":"Sushant Singh Rajput's sister-in-law passes away in Bihar","imageUrl":"dd365719-67c1-40f8-bc70-b98ada67ffab-maxresdefault.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-06-16T01:35:50.166Z","dateModified":"2020-06-16T01:40:52.515Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Sister-in-law of late Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput passed away in Bihar, multiple media reports stated.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAccording to a TOI report, Sudha Devi, wife of Sushant&rsquo;s cousin, passed away at his native, Purnia in Bihar.
