A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.</p>\n<p>Return true if there exists a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times, otherwise return false.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n<p>Input: arr = [1,2,4,4,4,4], m = 1, k = 3<br />Output: true<br />Explanation: The pattern (4) of length 1 is repeated 4 consecutive times. Notice that pattern can be repeated k or more times but not less.<br />Example 2:</p>\n<p>Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3], m = 2, k = 2<br />Output: true<br />Explanation: The pattern (1,2) of length 2 is repeated 2 consecutive times. Another valid pattern (2,1) is also repeated 2 times.<br />Example 3:</p>\n<p>Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,3], m = 2, k = 3<br />Output: false<br />Explanation: The pattern (1,2) is of length 2 but is repeated only 2 times. There is no pattern of length 2 that is repeated 3 or more times.<br />Example 4:</p>\n<p>Input: arr = [1,2,3,1,2], m = 2, k = 2<br />Output: false<br />Explanation: Notice that the pattern (1,2) exists twice but not consecutively, so it doesn't count.<br />Example 5:</p>\n<p>Input: arr = [2,2,2,2], m = 2, k = 3<br />Output: false<br />Explanation: The only pattern of length 2 is (2,2) however it's repeated only twice.
