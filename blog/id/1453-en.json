They said they were referring to hand-rolled cigarettes in their WhatsApp messages which mention the word &ldquo;doob&rdquo;. &ldquo;They said they don&rsquo;t even smoke cigarettes,&rdquo; said the official according to an online report.</p>\n<p>These actresses have also refuted any knowledge of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s alleged drug habit. The NCB officer said technical analysis of their mobile phones which were voluntarily surrendered will clear all doubts.<br />Meanwhile, a former executive producer of Dharmatic Entertainment, owned by Karan Johar, Kshitij Ravi Prasad was arrested in the case on Saturday and has been remanded to NCB&rsquo;s custody till October 3.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s among 20, including Rhea Chakraborty, who are in custody. An NCB official seeking Prasad&rsquo;s remand said he was a key accused linked to the &ldquo;drug syndicate&rdquo; and was being uncooperative.</p>\n<p>The remand application states that Prasad had taken delivery of ganja from Karamjeet alias Anand Singh and his associates Ankush Arneja and Kaizan Ibrahim, who are connected with Sushant&rsquo;s manager Samuel Miranda and hence NCB needed his custodial interrogation to probe deeper into his role.</p>\n<p>source: https://news.abplive.com/entertainment/movies/we-dont-even-smoke-said-deepika-sara-rakul-shraddha-ncb-official-1349980/amp</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/6f5d95b4-82c9-4928-9870-bc03267cd84a.png","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"slug":"we-dont-even-smoke-cigarettes-said-deepika-sara-rakul-shraddha-ncb-official","tags":[{"name":"india","slug":"india"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1385,"title":"Case filed against Sushant Singh Rajput's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty; Salman Khan appeals his fans to ‘support’ Sushant's fans, and more...","imageUrl":"b00a492c-d63b-4397-9d0e-cd1a1e6b92ca-76492557.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-06-21T10:06:32.692Z","dateModified":"2020-06-21T10:25:45.334Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Soon after Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s lifeless body was found hanging at his residence in Mumbai&rsquo;s Bandra on June 14, Mumbai Police began an investigation and recorded the statement of his girlfriend, actress Rhea Chakraborty.
