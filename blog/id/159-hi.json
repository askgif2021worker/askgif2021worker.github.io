It depends on the interpretation of the RFC. \r\nFor example in Java the URI parser does not like [ or ] and that's \r\nbecause the spec says \"should not\" and not \"shall not\".</code></pre>\r\n<p>So that muddies the waters further, unfortunately.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/1e0580ab-13aa-4a21-b447-cd35df82db9f_url-uri-urn.png","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"coding","slug":"coding"},"slug":"difference-between-a-uri-a-url-and-a-urn","tags":[{"name":"http","slug":"http"},{"name":"urn","slug":"urn"},{"name":"uri","slug":"uri"},{"name":"url","slug":"url"}],"recommendations":[{"id":159,"title":"Difference between a URI, a URL, and a URN?","imageUrl":"1e0580ab-13aa-4a21-b447-cd35df82db9f_url-uri-urn.png","dateCreated":"2018-11-28T11:27:14.154Z","dateModified":"2018-11-28T11:30:43.744Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"I have seen many people talk about URLs, URIs, and URNs as if they're different things, but they look the same to the naked eye.\r\nWhat are the distinguishable differences between them?\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFrom <a title=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt\" href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/1e0580ab-13aa-4a21-b447-cd35df82db9f_url-uri-urn.png","category":{"name":"coding","slug":"coding"},"tags":[{"name":"http","slug":"http"},{"name":"urn","slug":"urn"},{"name":"uri","slug":"uri"},{"name":"url","slug":"url"}],"slug":"difference-between-a-uri-a-url-and-a-urn","total":0}]}
