Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.</p>\n<p>You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.</p>\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n<p>Input: [1,4], 2<br />Output: 4<br />Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately.&nbsp;<br />This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2.&nbsp;<br />And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds.&nbsp;<br />So you finally need to output 4.<br />&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Example 2:</p>\n<p>Input: [1,2], 2<br />Output: 3<br />Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned.&nbsp;<br />This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2.&nbsp;<br />However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status.&nbsp;<br />Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3.&nbsp;<br />So you finally need to output 3.<br />&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>You may assume the length of the given time series array won't exceed 10000.<br />You may assume the numbers in Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-csharp\"><code>public class Solution {\n    public int FindPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {\n        if(timeSeries.Length==0){\n            return 0;\n        }                \n        \n        int total = duration;        \n        for(int i=timeSeries.Length-2;i&gt;=0;i--){\n            int diff = timeSeries[i+1]-timeSeries[i];\n            total += diff&gt;duration? duration: diff;\n        }\n        \n        return total;\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Time Complexity: O(n)</p>\n<p>Space Complexity: O(1)</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/03f183b7-2b4e-49b5-9009-249834a17a2e.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"coding","slug":"coding"},"slug":"teemo-attacking-array-medium-leetcode","tags":[{"name":"algorithm","slug":"algorithm"},{"name":"array","slug":"array"},{"name":"data-structure","slug":"data-structure"},{"name":"leetcode","slug":"leetcode"},{"name":"medium","slug":"medium"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1655,"title":"Sort Colors - Array - Medium - LeetCode","imageUrl":"icon_d14c2a98-a56d-44ac-9a21-2ed77349737c.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-10-31T11:30:17.677Z","dateModified":"2020-10-31T11:30:24.576Z","contributedBy":"sumitc91","content":"Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.\nHere, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.\n","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/d14c2a98-a56d-44ac-9a21-2ed77349737c.jpg","category":{"name":"coding","slug":"coding"},"tags":[{"name":"algorithm","slug":"algorithm"},{"name":"array","slug":"array"},{"name":"data-structure","slug":"data-structure"},{"name":"leetcode","slug":"leetcode"},{"name":"medium","slug":"medium"}],"slug":"sort-colors-array-medium-leetcode","total":0},{"id":1634,"title":"3Sum Closest - Array - Medium - LeetCode","imageUrl":"icon_981f57b3-a4c6-4c16-baeb-a49e75fe9497.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-10-23T07:22:34.29Z","dateModified":"2020-10-23T07:22:55.266Z","contributedBy":"sumitc91","content":"Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
