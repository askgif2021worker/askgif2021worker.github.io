Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.1</p>\n<p>We'll use a public REST API:</p>\n<p>$ curl -X POST --data '{ \"user_id\": \"foo\", \"account_url\": \"bar\", \\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; \"account_login\": \"baz\", \"account_password\": \"qux\" }' \\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://mint.com/api/v1/account<br />For internal communications, we could use Remote Procedure Calls.</p>\n<p>Next, the service extracts transactions from the account.</p>\n<p>Use case: Service extracts transactions from the account<br />We'll want to extract information from an account in these cases:</p>\n<p>The user first links the account<br />The user manually refreshes the account<br />Automatically each day for users who have been active in the past 30 days<br />Data flow:</p>\n<p>The Client sends a request to the Web Server<br />The Web Server forwards the request to the Accounts API server<br />The Accounts API server places a job on a Queue such as Amazon SQS or RabbitMQ<br />Extracting transactions could take awhile, we'd probably want to do this asynchronously with a queue, although this introduces additional complexity<br />The Transaction Extraction Service does the following:<br />Pulls from the Queue and extracts transactions for the given account from the financial institution, storing the results as raw log files in the Object Store<br />Uses the Category Service to categorize each transaction<br />Uses the Budget Service to calculate aggregate monthly spending by category<br />The Budget Service uses the Notification Service to let users know if they are nearing or have exceeded their budget<br />Updates the SQL Database transactions table with categorized transactions<br />Updates the SQL Database monthly_spending table with aggregate monthly spending by category<br />Notifies the user the transactions have completed through the Notification Service:<br />Uses a Queue (not pictured) to asynchronously send out notifications<br />The transactions table could have the following structure:</p>\n<p>id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT<br />created_at datetime NOT NULL<br />seller varchar(32) NOT NULL<br />amount decimal NOT NULL<br />user_id int NOT NULL<br />PRIMARY KEY(id)<br />FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)<br />We'll create an index on id, user_id , and created_at.</p>\n<p>The monthly_spending table could have the following structure:</p>\n<p>id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT<br />month_year date NOT NULL<br />category varchar(32)<br />amount decimal NOT NULL<br />user_id int NOT NULL<br />PRIMARY KEY(id)<br />FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)<br />We'll create an index on id and user_id .</p>\n<p>Category service<br />For the Category Service, we can seed a seller-to-category dictionary with the most popular sellers.

See Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.</p>\n<p>It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a Load Balancer with multiple Web Servers? CDN? Master-Slave Replicas? What are the alternatives and Trade-Offs for each?</p>\n<p>We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.</p>\n<p>To avoid repeating discussions, refer to the following system design topics for main talking points, tradeoffs, and alternatives:</p>\n<p>DNS<br />CDN<br />Load balancer<br />Horizontal scaling<br />Web server (reverse proxy)<br />API server (application layer)<br />Cache<br />Relational database management system (RDBMS)<br />SQL write master-slave failover<br />Master-slave replication<br />Asynchronism<br />Consistency patterns<br />Availability patterns<br />We'll add an additional use case: User accesses summaries and transactions.</p>\n<p>User sessions, aggregate stats by category, and recent transactions could be placed in a Memory Cache such as Redis or Memcached.</p>\n<p>The Client sends a read request to the Web Server<br />The Web Server forwards the request to the Read API server<br />Static content can be served from the Object Store such as S3, which is cached on the CDN<br />The Read API server does the following:<br />Checks the Memory Cache for the content<br />If the url is in the Memory Cache, returns the cached contents<br />Else<br />If the url is in the SQL Database, fetches the contents<br />Updates the Memory Cache with the contents<br />Refer to When to update the cache for tradeoffs and alternatives. The approach above describes cache-aside.</p>\n<p>Instead of keeping the monthly_spending aggregate table in the SQL Database, we could create a separate Analytics Database using a data warehousing solution such as Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.</p>\n<p>We might only want to store a month of transactions data in the database, while storing the rest in a data warehouse or in an Object Store. An Object Store such as Amazon S3 can comfortably handle the constraint of 250 GB of new content per month.</p>\n<p>To address the 200 average read requests per second (higher at peak), traffic for popular content should be handled by the Memory Cache instead of the database. The Memory Cache is also useful for handling the unevenly distributed traffic and traffic spikes. The SQL Read Replicas should be able to handle the cache misses, as long as the replicas are not bogged down with replicating writes.</p>\n<p>2,000 average transaction writes per second (higher at peak) might be tough for a single SQL Write Master-Slave. We might need to employ additional SQL scaling patterns:</p>\n<p>Federation<br />Sharding<br />Denormalization<br />SQL Tuning<br />We should also consider moving some data to a NoSQL Database.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/2709cf5f-1f6f-435b-bf00-9cf152142df5.png","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"tutorials","slug":"tutorials"},"slug":"how-to-design-mint.com","tags":[{"name":"design","slug":"design"},{"name":"interview","slug":"interview"},{"name":"system-design","slug":"system-design"}],"recommendations":[{"id":89,"title":"How to Check if a linked list is either NULL-terminated or ends in a cycle (cyclic)","imageUrl":"6ff093e0-9c78-4bb2-861e-5b96b8c47fcc_linkedlist-circle.png","dateCreated":"2018-08-07T11:26:31.699Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T11:36:20.812Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"So the question given is to check if the Given Linked list is having a cycle or Not?\r\nWe will be using Floyd Cycle to find the solution of the given problem.\r\nIt uses 2 pointers moving at different speeds to walking the linked list.
