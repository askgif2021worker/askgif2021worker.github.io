See Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.</p>\n<p>It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a Load Balancer with multiple Web Servers? CDN? Master-Slave Replicas? What are the alternatives and Trade-Offs for each?</p>\n<p>We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.</p>\n<p>To avoid repeating discussions, refer to the following system design topics for main talking points, tradeoffs, and alternatives:</p>\n<p>DNS<br />Load balancer<br />Horizontal scaling<br />Web server (reverse proxy)<br />API server (application layer)<br />Cache<br />Consistency patterns<br />Availability patterns<br />To address the constraint of 400 average read requests per second (higher at peak), person data can be served from a Memory Cache such as Redis or Memcached to reduce response times and to reduce traffic to downstream services. This could be especially useful for people who do multiple searches in succession and for people who are well-connected. Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.1</p>\n<p>Below are further optimizations:</p>\n<p>Store complete or partial BFS traversals to speed up subsequent lookups in the Memory Cache<br />Batch compute offline then store complete or partial BFS traversals to speed up subsequent lookups in a NoSQL Database<br />Reduce machine jumps by batching together friend lookups hosted on the same Person Server<br />Shard Person Servers by location to further improve this, as friends generally live closer to each other<br />Do two BFS searches at the same time, one starting from the source, and one from the destination, then merge the two paths<br />Start the BFS search from people with large numbers of friends, as they are more likely to reduce the number of degrees of separation between the current user and the search target<br />Set a limit based on time or number of hops before asking the user if they want to continue searching, as searching could take a considerable amount of time in some cases<br />Use a Graph Database such as Neo4j or a graph-specific query language such as GraphQL (if there were no constraint preventing the use of Graph Databases)</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/031621dc-30c0-4e0d-ba31-1f20a3884f5c.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"tutorials","slug":"tutorials"},"slug":"how-to-design-the-data-structures-for-a-social-network","tags":[{"name":"design","slug":"design"},{"name":"interview","slug":"interview"},{"name":"system-design","slug":"system-design"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1698,"title":"What is Application layer?","imageUrl":"icon_6faa8ad3-f4c7-411a-a351-f5721537582b.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-11-20T07:40:00.435Z","dateModified":"2020-11-20T07:40:05.453Z","contributedBy":"sumitc91","content":"Separating out the web layer from the application layer (also known as platform layer) allows you to scale and configure both layers independently.
