See Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.</p>\n<p>It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a Load Balancer with multiple Web Servers? CDN? Master-Slave Replicas? What are the alternatives and Trade-Offs for each?</p>\n<p>We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.</p>\n<p>To avoid repeating discussions, refer to the following system design topics for main talking points, tradeoffs, and alternatives:</p>\n<p>DNS<br />CDN<br />Load balancer<br />Horizontal scaling<br />Web server (reverse proxy)<br />API server (application layer)<br />Cache<br />Relational database management system (RDBMS)<br />SQL write master-slave failover<br />Master-slave replication<br />Consistency patterns<br />Availability patterns<br />The Analytics Database could use a data warehousing solution such as Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.</p>\n<p>We might only want to store a limited time period of data in the database, while storing the rest in a data warehouse or in an Object Store. An Object Store such as Amazon S3 can comfortably handle the constraint of 40 GB of new content per month.</p>\n<p>To address the 40,000 average read requests per second (higher at peak), traffic for popular content (and their sales rank) should be handled by the Memory Cache instead of the database. The Memory Cache is also useful for handling the unevenly distributed traffic and traffic spikes. With the large volume of reads, the SQL Read Replicas might not be able to handle the cache misses. We'll probably need to employ additional SQL scaling patterns.</p>\n<p>400 average writes per second (higher at peak) might be tough for a single SQL Write Master-Slave, also pointing to a need for additional scaling techniques.</p>\n<p>SQL scaling patterns include:</p>\n<p>Federation<br />Sharding<br />Denormalization<br />SQL Tuning<br />We should also consider moving some data to a NoSQL Database.</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/6a724e39-5b07-478b-a4ae-af8ecae9210e.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"tutorials","slug":"tutorials"},"slug":"how-to-design-amazons-sales-rank-by-category-feature","tags":[{"name":"design","slug":"design"},{"name":"interview","slug":"interview"},{"name":"system-design","slug":"system-design"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1693,"title":"Availability vs consistency","imageUrl":"icon_a22695c8-b2d8-4ca6-8546-265c07e566d7.png","dateCreated":"2020-11-20T07:30:12.189Z","dateModified":"2020-11-20T07:30:26.472Z","contributedBy":"sumitc91","content":"CAP theorem\nIn a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:\nConsistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error<br />Availability - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version o","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/a22695c8-b2d8-4ca6-8546-265c07e566d7.png","category":{"name":"tutorials","slug":"tutorials"},"tags":[{"name":"interview","slug":"interview"}],"slug":"availability-vs-consistency","total":0},{"id":100,"title":"What is a Queue?","imageUrl":"f653b2fa-6790-4d95-b5cf-1eafcce38bda_Data_Queue.png","dateCreated":"2018-08-08T11:20:40.978Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T11:20:49.04Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"A queue is a data structure used for storing data (similar to Linked Lists and Stacks).
