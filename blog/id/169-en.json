In Padmapuraan, Vindhyachal-Nivasini has been associated with the name of&nbsp; Vindhavsinini, the super power of this Vindhyvindhidhasini. The story comes in the Dasam Skand of Shrimdev Bhagavat, when Brahma ji first creates Swayambhavvammanu and Shatruupa with his mind. Then after marriage, Swayambhav Manu made a statue of Goddess with his hands and performed harsh tenacity for a hundred years. Satisfied with his austerity, Bhagwati blessed him with a state of deserving state, family growth and the highest post. Mahadevi went to Vindhyachalvarvata after giving his blessing. From this it is clear that from the beginning of creation, the worship of Vindhyaswini is being done.

On the National Highway 2 (NH 2) road, which is incidentally part of Asian Highway 1 (AH1), take turn Southward, either at Gopiganj or Aurai, both places between Allahabad and Varanasi. After crossing Holy River Ganga, through Shastri Bridge, via State Highway 5, you will easily reach Vindhyachal.
