Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.</p>\n<p>Additional benefits include:</p>\n<p>Increased security - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client<br />Increased scalability and flexibility - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration<br />SSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations<br />Removes the need to install X.509 certificates on each server<br />Compression - Compress server responses<br />Caching - Return the response for cached requests<br />Static content - Serve static content directly<br />HTML/CSS/JS<br />Photos<br />Videos<br />Etc<br />Load balancer vs reverse proxy<br />Deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers. Often, load balancers route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.<br />Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server, opening up the benefits described in the previous section.<br />Solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.<br />Disadvantage(s): reverse proxy<br />Introducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity.<br />A single reverse proxy is a single point of failure, configuring multiple reverse proxies (ie a failover) further increases complexity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/c9b9941f-ccf0-43b6-8c8d-af837fe0b02d.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"tutorials","slug":"tutorials"},"slug":"what-is-reverse-proxy-web-server","tags":[{"name":"interview","slug":"interview"}],"recommendations":[{"id":93,"title":"How will you display a linked list from the end?","imageUrl":"34a6fa21-0896-44c8-a8c2-686bacb89acc_linked-list-reverse.png","dateCreated":"2018-08-07T15:22:07.903Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T15:22:25.327Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Traverse recursively till the end of the linked list.
