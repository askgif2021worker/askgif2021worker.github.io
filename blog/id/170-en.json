Multiple modes of public transport are available such as metro rail, taxis, city buses, cycle rickshaws, auto rickshaws and compressed natural gas (CNG) low floor buses with and without air conditioning. CNG was introduced as an auto fuel to keep air pollution under control. Radio Taxis are operated by several major companies like Ola and Uber</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>City buses</p>\r\n<p>Lucknow city's bus service is operated by Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC), a public sector passenger road transport corporation headquartered in Mahatma Gandhi road. It has 300 CNG buses operating in the city. There are around 35 routes in the city. Terminals for city buses are located in Gudamba, Viraj Khand, Alambagh, Scooter India, Institute of Engineering and Technology, Babu Banarasi Das University, Safedabad, Pasi qila, Charbagh, Andhe Ki Chowki, and the Budheshwar Intersection.

Located on National Highway 25, it provides adequate services to ongoing and incoming customers. There is a smaller bus station at Qaiserbagh. The bus terminal formally operated at Charbagh, in front of the main railway station, has now been re-established as a city bus depot. This decision was taken by the state government and UPSRTC to decongest traffic in the railway station area. Kanpur Lucknow Roadways Service is a key service for daily commuters who travel back and forth to the city for business and educational purposes. Air conditioned \"Royal Cruiser\" buses manufactured by Volvo are operated by UPSRTC for inter state bus services. Main cities served by the UPSRTC intrastate bus service are Allahabad, Varanasi, Jaipur, Jhansi, Agra, Delhi, Gorakhpur. The cities outside Uttar Pradesh that are covered by inter-state bus services are Jaipur, New Delhi, Kota, Singrauli, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Dausa, Ajmer, Dehradun, and Haridwar.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Railways</p>\r\n<p>Lucknow Railway Station</p>\r\n<p>Lucknow is served by several railway stations in different parts of the city. The main long-distance railway station is Lucknow Railway Station located at Charbagh. It has an imposing structure built in 1923 and acts as the divisional headquarters of the Northern Railway division. Its neighbouring and second major long-distance railway station is Lucknow Junction railway station operated by the North Eastern Railway. The city is an important junction with links to all major cities of the state and country such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Amritsar, Jammu, Chennai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Pune, Indore, Bhopal, Jhansi, Jabalpur, Jaipur, Raipur and Siwan. The city has a total of fourteen railway stations[96] with meter gauge services originating at Aishbagh and connecting to Lucknow city, Daliganj and Mohibullapur. Except for Mohibullapur, all stations are connected to broad gauge and metre gauge railways. All stations lie within the city limits and are well interconnected by bus services and other public road transport. Suburban stations include Bakshi Ka Talab and Kakori. The Lucknow&ndash;Kanpur Suburban Railway was started in 1867 to cater for the needs of commuters travelling between Lucknow and Kanpur. Trains running on this service also stop at numerous stations at different locations in the city forming a suburban rail network.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Air transport</p>\r\n<p>Terminal-2, CCS International Airport</p>\r\n<p>Direct air connections are available in Lucknow to New Delhi, Patna, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Guwahati, Jaipur, Raipur and other major cities via Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport. The airport has been ranked the second best in the world in small airport category.[98] The airport is suitable for all-weather operations and provides parking facilities for up to 50 aircraft. At present, Air India, Air India Express, Jet Air, GoAir, IndiGo, Saudi Airlines, Flydubai, Oman Air and Air Vistara operate domestic and international flights to and from Lucknow.

There is also a plan for runway expansion. It is the 10th-busiest airport in India, busiest in Uttar Pradesh, and second-busiest in North India.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Metro</p>\r\n<p>Lucknow Metro is a rapid transit system which started its operations from 6 September 2017. Lucknow Metro system is the fastest built metro system in the world and most economical high-speed rapid transit system project in India. The commencement of civil works started on 27 September 2014.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Charbagh Metro Station</p>\r\n<p>In February, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav gave the approval to set up a metro rail system for the state capital. It is divided into two corridors with the North-South corridor connecting Munshipulia to CCS International Airport and the East-West corridor connecting Charbagh Railway Station to Vasant Kunj. This will be the most expensive public transport system in the state but will provide a rapid means of mass transport to decongest traffic on city roads. Construction of the first phase will be complete by March 2017. The completion of metro rail project is the primary object of Uttar Pradesh government currently headed by the chief minister Yogi Adityanath</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On 5 September 2017, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and CM Yogi Adityanath showed green flag to the Lucknow Metro.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cycling</p>\r\n<p>Lucknow is among the most bicycle-friendly cities in Uttar Pradesh. Bike-friendly tracks have been established near the Chief Minister's residence in the city. The four-and-a-half-kilometre track encompasses La-Martiniere College Road next to Golf Club on Kalidas Marg, where the Chief Minister resides, and Vikramaditya Marg, which houses the office of the ruling party. The dedicated four-metre-wide lane for cyclists is separate from the footpath and the main road. With Amsterdam as the inspiration, new cycle tracks are to be constructed in the city to make it more cycle-friendly, with facilities like bike rental also in the works.[107][108] In the year 2015, Lucknow also hosted a national level cycling event called 'The Lucknow Cyclothon' in which professional and amateur cyclists took part.[109] An under-construction cycle track network by the Government Of Uttar Pradesh is set to make Lucknow the city with India's biggest cycle network.</p>","SubContentHindi":null,"ImageUrl":"5e96ef9c-417f-434d-9233-f23fa46f681a_Lucknow-map.jpg","HdImageUrl":null,"gifUrl":null,"Priority":"6"}],"category":{"name":"travel","slug":"travel"},"slug":"top-places-to-visit-in-lucknow-uttar-pradesh","tags":[{"name":"lucknow","slug":"lucknow"},{"name":"uttar-pradesh","slug":"uttar-pradesh"}],"recommendations":[{"id":177,"title":"Top Places to visit in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh","imageUrl":"385151a8-01b5-401b-8479-3039574d2bc6_Moradabad-railway.jpg","dateCreated":"2018-12-20T15:24:46.356Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T15:36:22.497Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Moradabad is a city, commissionary, and a municipal corporation in Moradabad district of Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
