Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.1</p>\n<p>Since the cache has limited capacity, we'll use a least recently used (LRU) approach to expire older entries.</p>\n<p>The Client sends a request to the Web Server, running as a reverse proxy<br />The Web Server forwards the request to the Query API server<br />The Query API server does the following:<br />Parses the query<br />Removes markup<br />Breaks up the text into terms<br />Fixes typos<br />Normalizes capitalization<br />Converts the query to use boolean operations<br />Checks the Memory Cache for the content matching the query<br />If there's a hit in the Memory Cache, the Memory Cache does the following:<br />Updates the cached entry's position to the front of the LRU list<br />Returns the cached contents<br />Else, the Query API does the following:<br />Uses the Reverse Index Service to find documents matching the query<br />The Reverse Index Service ranks the matching results and returns the top ones<br />Uses the Document Service to return titles and snippets<br />Updates the Memory Cache with the contents, placing the entry at the front of the LRU list<br />Cache implementation<br />The cache can use a doubly-linked list: new items will be added to the head while items to expire will be removed from the tail.

See Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.</p>\n<p>It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a Load Balancer with multiple Web Servers? CDN? Master-Slave Replicas? What are the alternatives and Trade-Offs for each?</p>\n<p>We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.</p>\n<p>To avoid repeating discussions, refer to the following system design topics for main talking points, tradeoffs, and alternatives:</p>\n<p>DNS<br />Load balancer<br />Horizontal scaling<br />Web server (reverse proxy)<br />API server (application layer)<br />Cache<br />Consistency patterns<br />Availability patterns<br />Expanding the Memory Cache to many machines<br />To handle the heavy request load and the large amount of memory needed, we'll scale horizontally. We have three main options on how to store the data on our Memory Cache cluster:</p>\n<p>Each machine in the cache cluster has its own cache - Simple, although it will likely result in a low cache hit rate.<br />Each machine in the cache cluster has a copy of the cache - Simple, although it is an inefficient use of memory.<br />The cache is sharded across all machines in the cache cluster - More complex, although it is likely the best option. We could use hashing to determine which machine could have the cached results of a query using machine = hash(query). We'll likely want to use consistent hashing.</p>","ampImage":null,"subContents":[],"category":{"name":"tutorials","slug":"tutorials"},"slug":"how-to-design-a-key-value-cache-to-save-the-results-of-the-most-recent-web-server-queries","tags":[{"name":"design","slug":"design"},{"name":"interview","slug":"interview"},{"name":"system-design","slug":"system-design"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1687,"title":"How to Design Mint.com","imageUrl":"icon_2709cf5f-1f6f-435b-bf00-9cf152142df5.png","dateCreated":"2020-11-20T06:53:27.643Z","dateModified":"2020-11-20T06:53:36.94Z","contributedBy":"sumitc91","content":"Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints<br />Gather requirements and scope the problem.
