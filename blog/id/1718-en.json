He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.</p>\n<p>He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.<br />Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n<p>Input: n = 4<br />Output: 10<br />Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.<br />Example 2:</p>\n<p>Input: n = 10<br />Output: 37<br />Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37.
