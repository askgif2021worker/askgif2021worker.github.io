It is believed to have been built by the great warrior Bhima, one of the Pandavas in the epic Mahabharata. It is also rumored to have been a place where Lord Krishna had a night halt during his last attempt to avoid Mahabharata and hence was named after him. Another fable describes Shamli as a place where Lord Hanuman rested during his journey to fetch \"Sanjivani Booti\" from the Himalayas for Laxman. It is also known[citation needed] to be a probable site of resting of priests who accompanied Marathas in the Battle of Panipat.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The temple currently hosts many celebrations through the year on religious occasions and facilitates the yearly Kanwar Yatra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are many temples and mosques of reverence in the district.</p>\r\n<p>source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamli</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/4fbecf12-2fb5-4703-9846-e8d73704889f_shamli-railway.jpg","subContents":[{"SubTitle":"1.
