Really?","imageUrl":"5177c987-2e91-4e1b-8b1e-cd02614a7d04_superstition-totka.jpg","dateCreated":"2018-12-27T14:39:20.092Z","dateModified":"2018-12-27T14:44:35.706Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"<p>Every development seems futile when you come across certain incidents in life. Our domestic help, say Mala, shared her fears with me today. She is a hardworking woman, who helps with the daily chores of 4-5 homes and earns her living. She is a single mother of three children- one married daughter and two younger boys (around 5-6 years old). She wears a bold crimson line on her forehead, even after her husband and she have separated. She says, it makes her feel safe and prevents bitter questions, at least on her face. Well, that is another long story. Today, she seemed unwell. When I asked her, she started crying like a baby and said, \"Didi, you know what a totka is? Somebody did that on my house. They wrote my name, my daughter's name and other things on a paper along with some hair, chicken's beak, peacock feather, et cetera. I am afraid what will happen now, to me, my children. They are so young. They cannot even fight for themselves. This has been running on my mind since the past two days. I haven't been able to eat. I am not feeling well. I don't know what to do.\" She was frightened. She kept crying. I fetched a glass of water and asked her to calm down. I tried to explain her that all these things are weapons people have to instil fear in the minds of people like her. If she gets terrified, the purpose of the totka will be accomplished. I tried explaining to her that she will take it to someone, who claims to solve the mystery of the totka,and ask for money in lieu of the help. She will end up wasting her hard-earned money in the process. I asked her to be brave, to go home, eat well and sleep sound (and not watch TV all evening). She said,\"Didi, you are right, but I am afraid if something wrong happens. I have understood what you are saying. I will keep it in mind. But, I don't know...\" I asked her to be careful and to not be tensed at what happened. Being terrified is not the answer. Such things make me ponder- despite all our advancements, there are some things that continue to frighten people. Such fears are so deeply set in our conscience that fighting them feels like one tough battle. I just hope she takes care of her health, eats well, and when I see her on Sunday, I see the usual Mala braving her odds with a smile.</p>\r\n<p>courtesy: Parul Kaushik</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/5177c987-2e91-4e1b-8b1e-cd02614a7d04_superstition-totka.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"story","slug":"story"},"slug":"totka-really","tags":[{"name":"felt-it-wrote-it","slug":"felt-it-wrote-it"},{"name":"parul-thinks-parul-says","slug":"parul-thinks-parul-says"},{"name":"superstition","slug":"superstition"},{"name":"black-magic","slug":"black-magic"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1365,"title":"Should India pursue Nuclear Power?","imageUrl":"10ef9071-4b01-4d78-a7ec-be67f7e6bcf8-nuclear.jpg","dateCreated":"2020-06-14T12:53:51.367Z","dateModified":"2020-06-14T12:54:25.153Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Kudankulam, supposedly one of India&rsquo;s most successful nuclear power plants, faced a huge uproar by civil society post the 2011 Fukushima disaster.
