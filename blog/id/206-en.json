The athletics events, which take place at each Games, are divided into four groups: track events (including sprints, middle- and long-distance running, hurdling and relays), field events (including javelin, discus, hammer, pole vault, long and triple jumps), road events (such as walks and the marathon) and combined events (the heptathlon and the decathlon).[1] Women compete in 23 athletics events during the Games,[2] and men compete in 24; while 21 of the events are the same for both men and women, men exclusively compete in the 50 km walk, the women's combined event is the heptathlon while the men compete in the decathlon, and the short distance hurdles for women is contested over 100 m, ten metres shorter than the men's event.[1]</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some Olympic records have been broken but later rescinded by the IOC. In 1988, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson broke the Olympic and World record in the 100 metres sprint, but was subsequently disqualified after it was discovered that he had used anabolic steroids to enhance his performance. His record was expunged and the gold medal was instead awarded to American Carl Lewis.[3] Hungarian athlete R&oacute;bert Fazekas broke the Olympic record in the men's discus in 2004 but was later stripped of both his gold medal and the record after it was deemed that he had \"committed an anti-doping rule violation\".[4][5]</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The longest standing modern Olympic athletics record is Bob Beamon's achievement in the men's long jump at the 1968 Summer Olympics.[6] The jump, at 8.90 m (29 ft 2 in), also broke the existing world record by 55 cm (22 in), and stood as the world record for 23 years until Beamon's compatriot, Mike Powell, jumped farther in the 1991 World Championships in Athletics in Tokyo.[7] During the 2012 Games, six men's and five women's records were broken.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Note, only those events currently competed for and recognised by the IOC as Summer Olympic events are listed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>List of men's Olympic records in athletics</p>\r\n<p>Event Record Athlete(s) Nation Games Date Ref(s)</p>\r\n<p>100 metres 9.63 Usain Bolt Jamaica (JAM) 2012 London August 5, 2012 [9]</p>\r\n<p>200 metres 19.30 Usain Bolt Jamaica (JAM) 2008 Beijing August 20, 2008 [10]</p>\r\n<p>400 metres 43.03 Wayde van Niekerk South Africa (RSA) 2016 Rio de Janeiro August 14, 2016 [11]</p>\r\n<p>800 metres 1:40.91 David Rudisha Kenya (KEN) 2012 London August 9, 2012 [12]</p>\r\n<p>1,500 metres 3:32.07 Noah Ngeny Kenya (KEN) 2000 Sydney September 29, 2000 [13]</p>\r\n<p>5,000 metres 12:57.82 Kenenisa Bekele Ethiopia (ETH) 2008 Beijing August 23, 2008 [14]</p>\r\n<p>10,000 metres 27:01.17 Kenenisa Bekele Ethiopia (ETH) 2008 Beijing August 17, 2008 [15]</p>\r\n<p>Marathon 2:06:32 Samuel Wanjiru Kenya (KEN) 2008 Beijing August 24, 2008 [16]</p>\r\n<p>110 metres hurdles 12.91 Liu Xiang China (CHN) 2004 Athens August 27, 2004 [17]</p>\r\n<p>400 metres hurdles 46.78 Kevin Young United States (USA) 1992 Barcelona August 6, 1992 [18][19]</p>\r\n<p>3,000 m steeplechase 8:03.28 Conseslus Kipruto Kenya (KEN) 2016 Rio de Janeiro August 17, 2016 [20]</p>\r\n<p>4&times;100 m relay 36.84 Nesta Carter</p>\r\n<p>Michael Frater</p>\r\n<p>Yohan Blake</p>\r\n<p>Usain Bolt Jamaica (JAM) 2012 London August 11, 2012 [21]</p>\r\n<p>4&times;400 m relay 2:55.39 LaShawn Merritt</p>\r\n<p>Angelo Taylor</p>\r\n<p>David Neville</p>\r\n<p>Jeremy Wariner United States (USA) 2008 Beijing August 23, 2008 [22]</p>\r\n<p>20 km walk 1:18:46 Chen Ding China (CHN) 2012 London August 4, 2012 [23]</p>\r\n<p>50 km walk 3:36:53 Jared Tallent Australia (AUS) 2012 London August 11, 2012 [24]</p>\r\n<p>High jump 2.39 m Charles Austin United States (USA) 1996 Atlanta July 28, 1996 [25]</p>\r\n<p>Long jump 8.90 m Bob Beamon United States (USA) 1968 Mexico City October 18, 1968 [6]</p>\r\n<p>Pole vault 6.03 m Thiago Braz da Silva Brazil (BRA) 2016 Rio de Janeiro August 15, 2016 [26]</p>\r\n<p>Triple jump 18.09 m Kenny Harrison United States (USA) 1996 Atlanta July 27, 1996 [27]</p>\r\n<p>Shot put 22.52 m Ryan Crouser United States (USA) 2016 Rio de Janeiro August 18, 2016 [28]</p>\r\n<p>Discus throw 69.89 m Virgilijus Alekna Lithuania (LTU) 2004 Athens August 23, 2004 [29]</p>\r\n<p>Hammer throw 84.80 m Sergey Litvinov Soviet Union (URS) 1988 Seoul September 26, 1988 [30]</p>\r\n<p>Javelin throw 90.57 m Andreas Thorkildsen Norway (NOR) 2008 Beijing August 23, 2008 [31]</p>\r\n<p>Decathlon 8893 pts Roman &Scaron;ebrle Czech Republic (CZE) 2004 Athens August 24, 2004 [32]</p>\r\n<p>Ashton Eaton United States (USA) 2016 Rio de Janeiro August 18, 2016 [33]</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Women's records</p>\r\n<p>List of women's Olympic records in athletics</p>\r\n<p>Event Record Athlete(s) Nation Games Date Ref(s)</p>\r\n<p>100 metres 10.62 Florence Griffith-Joyner United States (USA) 1988 Seoul September 24, 1988 [34]</p>\r\n<p>200 metres 21.34 Florence Griffith-Joyner United States (USA) 1988 Seoul September 29, 1988 [35][36]</p>\r\n<p>400 metres 48.25 Marie-Jos&eacute;
