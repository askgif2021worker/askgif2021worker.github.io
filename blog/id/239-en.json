Traditionally, four fairs are widely recognized as the Kumbh Melas: the Prayagraj Kumbh Mela, Haridwar Kumbh Mela, the Nashik-Trimbakeshwar Simhastha, and Ujjain Simhastha. These four fairs are held periodically at one of the following places by rotation: Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik district (Nashik and Trimbak), and Ujjain. The main festival site is located on the banks of a river: the Ganges (Ganga) at Haridwar; the confluence (Sangam) of the Ganges and the Yamuna and the invisible Sarasvati at Prayagraj; the Godavari at Nashik; and the Shipra at Ujjain. Bathing in these rivers is thought to cleanse a person of all their sins.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At any given place, the Kumbh Mela is held once in 12 years. There is a difference of around 3 years between the Kumbh Melas at Haridwar and Nashik; the fairs at Nashik and Ujjain are celebrated in the same year or one year apart. The exact date is determined, as per Vikram Samvat calendar and the principles of Jyotisha, according to a combination of zodiac positions of the Jupiter, the Sun and the Moon. At Nashik and Ujjain, the Mela may be held while a planet is in Leo (Simha in Hindu astrology); in this case, it is also known as Simhastha. At Haridwar and Prayagraj, an Ardha (\"Half\") Kumbh Mela is held every sixth year; a Maha (\"Great\") Kumbh Mela occurs after 12 years. The priests at other places have also claimed their local fairs to be Kumbh Melas. For example, the Mahamaham festival at Kumbakonam, held once in 12 years, is also portrayed as a Kumbh Mela. Other places where fairs called Kumbh Melas have been hosted include Kurukshetra and Sonepat</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The exact age of the festival is uncertain. According to medieval Hinduism, Lord Vishnu dropped drops of Amrita (the drink of immortality) at four places, while transporting it in a kumbha (pot). These four places are identified as the present-day sites of the Kumbh Mela. The name \"Kumbh Mela\" literally means \"kumbha fair\". It is known as \"Kumbh\" in Hindi (due to schwa deletion); in Sanskrit and some other Indian languages, it is more often known by its original name \"Kumbha\".</p>\r\n<p>The festival is the largest peaceful gatherings in the world, and considered as the \"world's largest congregation of religious pilgrims\". There is no precise method of ascertaining the number of pilgrims, and the estimates of the number of pilgrims bathing on the most auspicious day may vary. An estimated 120 million people visited Maha Kumbh Mela in 2013 in Prayagraj over a two-month period, including over 30 million on a single day, on 10 February 2013 (the day of Mauni Amavasya).

To seize the Amrit from the demons, Garuda (vehicle of Lord Vishnu) took the pot and flew away. During his flight, he spilled drops of the drink on earth at 4 places namely, Haridwar, Ujjain, Prayag (Allahabad), and Nashik. Making these places as well as the rivers flowing in the cities holy.

These saints are said to be followers of Lord Shiva and Vishnu, hence there are Shaivite Akharas (dedicated to Shiva) and there are Vaishnavite Akharas (dedicated to Vishnu). The holy men that are part of these groups are often seen with matted hair, some even bare body, and some donned in saffron clothes. Ardh Kumbh will be the perfect opportunity to learn about these religious groups and capturing them in lense as some of them make for unique pictures.The Sadhus and Saints being the most integral part of Kumbh Mela increases the holiness of the fair with their presence. The devotees can listen to the speeches of these people in order to gain spiritual enlightenment. Amongst the several Akharas and the group of Babas (saints), there are some that catches the eyes the most like:</p>\r\n<p>Nagas: These are the saints who wear no clothes with ash smeared all over their body and have long matted hair. Their body is constantly exposed to the extremity of the Himalayas where they reside for the most part of the year, due to which they become resistant towards the weather change. For a long time, Naga Babas have been the favorite of photographers for being different from others, they are mostly quiet and are amongst the first to take the Royal Bath, which we discussed earlier.Urdhwavahurs: This group of holy men practices spiritual activities and they can be recognized as they too have bone-thin body structure. These religious men perform rituals while making their bodies undergo several austerities.Kalpvasis: This group of saints resides by the river banks and spend hours meditating and performing spiritual activities. They keep themselves clean by bathing numerous times in a day in the river water.Shirshasinse: This group of saints is very different from the others and the thing that separated them is their way of meditating and sleeping. They meditate while standing on their heads and sleep in an upright position taking a support of pole or a wall.Parivajakash: These saints never speak as they have taken the oath to keep quiet. They carry a bell and ring it all along to tell the people about their presence.</p>","SubContentHindi":null,"ImageUrl":"28f58b83-338b-4dec-a6e2-50018ab55a31_Akharas-and-the-Sadhus.jpg","HdImageUrl":null,"gifUrl":null,"Priority":"3"},{"SubTitle":"4.
