Saharsa and its surrounding areas occupy a flat alluvial plain forming part of the Kosi river basin. The town lies in the Kosi alluvial megafan, one of the largest alluvial fans in the world. The land is very fertile but frequent changes in the course of the Kosi, one of the largest tributaries of the Ganges, have led to the problems associated with soil erosion. Flooding is a major reason for the poor connectivity of the area; bridges are often washed away. Major flooding occurs almost annually, causing a significant loss of life and property.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Saharsa is one of the thirty-eight districts of Bihar, India. Saharsa town is the administrative headquarters of this district.
