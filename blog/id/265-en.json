The district, part of Saran Division, is also known as Chhapra district after the headquarters of the district, Chhapra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Geography</p>\r\n<p>Saran district occupies an area of 2,641 square kilometres (1,020 sq mi), equivalent to Drenthe province in the Netherlands.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The district of Saran is situated between 25&deg;36' and 26&deg;13' north latitude and 84&deg;24' and 85&deg;15' east longitude in the southern post of the Saran Division of North Bihar. The Ganges river provides the southern boundary of the district, beyond which lie the districts of Bhojpur and Patna. To the north of Saran lie the districts of Siwan and Gopalganj. The Gandak river forms the dividing line with the Vaishali and Muzaffarpur districts in the east. To the west of Saran lie the districts of Siwan and Balia in Uttar Pradesh. The Ghaghra river forms a natural boundary between Saran and Ballia.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The district is shaped like a triangle; its apex is the confluence of the boundary of the Gopalganj district and the Gandak &ndash; Ganges river. The district is made up entirely of plains, but several depressions and marshes create three broad natural divisions:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The alluvial plains along the big rivers, which are subject to periodic inundation.</p>\r\n<p>The uplands away from the rivers, not subject to floods.</p>\r\n<p>The riverbed diara areas.</p>\r\n<p>Out of twenty blocks in the districts, six (Sonepur, Dighwara, Revelganj, chapra, Manjhi and Dariyapur) regularly flood. Six others are partially affected by floods (Parsa, Marhoura, Amnaur, Jalalpur, and Ekma). The soil of the district is alluvial. No minerals of economic value are found in the district.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>India's biggest double-decker flyover is being constructed in Chhapra. This 3.5 km long double-decker flyover from Gandhi Chowk to Nagarpalika Chowk, is being constructed at the cost of â‚¹ 411.31 crore from the central road fund (CRF) under engineering procurement construction (EPC) mode by Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL). It is longer than the 1.8 km double-decker flyover in Santa Cruz&ndash;Chembur Link Road. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar laid the foundation stone of this double-decker flyover in July 2018, which is set to be completed by June 2022. The width of the flyover will be 5.5 meters. The double-decker flyover will be constructed from the eastern side of Bhikhari Thakur roundabout on NH- 19 crossing the Police Lines, Gandhi Chowk, Mouna Chowk, Nagarpalika (Rajendra) Chowk, bus stand and end at Daroga Rai Chowk near Zila school on the western side of Chhapra. The upper portion of the double-decker flyover bridge would be 3.5 km long and the lower portion 3 km.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Institutions/Organisation</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A.
