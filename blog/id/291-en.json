While 83 terrorists had assembled for Daura-e-Aam &mdash; the beginners&rsquo; training course, 91 terrorists had assembled for Daura-e-Khas &mdash; advanced training. A total of 25 were selected for special training as fidayeens.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Further, 30 had assembled for Daura-e-Mautulah and some 18 to 20 were working staff, including cooks and barbers.

Just days ago, satellite images published in the international media had claimed that the JeM camp had not been hit by Indian jets. Then also, Times Now had shown satellite images to counter and debunk those claims and clearly establish that buildings at the JeM camp were hits by missiles launched by Mirage-2000 jets.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As per details available, the presence of 263 terrorists at the JeM camp was established by Indian intelligence agencies. The top leadership of the JeM had assembled at the Balakot facility in the run-up to several terror training courses that were due to start on February 25.</p>\r\n<p>source: https://oneplus6.page.link/balakot-casalties-revealed</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/9bdaee4e-261e-4e41-a452-05027b04ebae_Indian-air-strikes.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"slug":"balakot-air-strikes-count-revealed-263-terrorists-had-assembled-at-jem-camp-in-pak-for-training-exclusive","tags":[{"name":"india","slug":"india"},{"name":"pakistan","slug":"pakistan"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1373,"title":"Sushant Singh Rajput suicide case: Mumbai Police grill Rhea Chakraborty for almost 9 hours, actress confesses she had a fight with Sushant","imageUrl":"dcf5715f-c41c-4839-9172-45a84d8c339b-sushant.jpeg","dateCreated":"2020-06-19T06:18:04.528Z","dateModified":"2020-06-19T06:37:02.916Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"On June 18, late actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s rumored girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty was interrogated by the Mumbai Police for almost 9 hours straight in the ongoing investigations into the actor&rsquo;s suicide.
