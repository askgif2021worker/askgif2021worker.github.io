The story conveys names and location of the Cheethu-Huluni or the twelve rivers that the Mishmi (Idu) people came over in the region and settled around. The first accounts of the Mishmi (Idus) are found in the narrations given by the neighbouring Ahoms. The Mishmis inhabited the deep jungles of what is now the Dibang valley.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Religion</p>\r\n<p>Total population: 7,272 (2001)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hindus:3,639 (50.04%)</p>\r\n<p>Animist: 2,881 (39.62%)</p>\r\n<p>Buddhist: 160 (2.20%)</p>\r\n<p>Muslim: 126 (1.73%)</p>\r\n<p>Christian: 97 (1.33%)</p>\r\n<p>Sikh: 19 (0.26%)</p>\r\n<p>Religion Unknown: 350 (4.81%)</p>\r\n<p>Languages</p>\r\n<p>Languages spoken include Mishmi, a Sino-Tibetan tongue with approximately 25000 speakers, written in both the Tibetan and Latin scripts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Flora and fauna</p>\r\n<p>The district is rich in wildlife.
