Chirang district has been carved out from Bongaigaon district in 2004. The word \"Chirang\" has derived from Garo word -\"Chi\" means Water and \"Rang\" means wealth. It may also be a copy of tsirang district of neighbouring Bhutan. On the other hand, Most of the people regarded the word Chirang is derived from the Bodo word Chirang or Sirang. Si means life and Rang means Money. Sirang was an area which is covered by valuable soil, plants, tress, flora and fauna or the things which are necessary for human life. Thus it is a place which is important for human life or the place which is just like money or valuable for life and is later come to know Si + Rang = sirang.
