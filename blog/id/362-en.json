Kamrup district has some territorial disputes with neighbouring West Khasi Hills district, Meghalaya, including that over the village of Langpih.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hydrography</p>\r\n<p>In the immediate neighborhood of the Brahmaputra the land is low, and exposed to annual inundation. In this marshy tract reeds and canes flourish luxuriantly, and the only cultivation is that of rice. At a comparatively short distance from the river banks the ground begins to rise in undulating knolls towards the mountains of Bhutan on the north, and towards the Khasi hills on the south. The hills south of the Brahmaputra in some parts reach the height of 800 feet (240 m). The Brahmaputra, which divides the district into two nearly equal portions, is navigable by river steamers throughout the year, and receives several tributaries navigable by large native boats in the rainy season. The chief of these are the Manas, Chaul Khoya and Barnadi on the north, and the Kulsi and Dibru on the south bank.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Flora and fauna</p>\r\n<p>In 1989 Kamrup district became home to the Dipor Bil Wildlife Sanctuary, which has an area of 4.1 km2 (1.6 sq mi). There is also a plantation where seedlings of teak, sal, sissu, sum, and nahor are reared, and experiments are being made with the caoutchouc tree.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kamrup is home to one of the few large colonies of greater adjutant storks still in existence. The villagers previously regarded the birds as pests, but outreach efforts including cultural and religious programming, especially aimed at local women, have rallied Kamrup residents to be proud of and protect the storks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Demographics</p>\r\n<p>Population</p>\r\n<p>According to the 2011 census Kamrup district has a population of 1,517,202, roughly equal to the West African country of Gabon or the US state of Hawaii.
