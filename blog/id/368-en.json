It had an area of 880 square kilometres (340 sq mi) at the beginning of the 20th century, but having lost significantly to erosion it covers 352 square kilometres (136 sq mi) as at 2014. Majuli has shrunk as the river surrounding it has grown. Majuli is currently listed as the world's largest river island in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The island is formed by the Brahmaputra river in the south and the Kherkutia Xuti, an anabranch of the Brahmaputra, joined by the Subansiri River in the north. Mājuli island is accessible by ferries from the city of Jorhat. The island is about 300&ndash;400 kilometres (186&ndash;249 mi) east from the state's largest city &mdash;Guwahati. It was formed due to course changes by the river Brahmaputra and its tributaries, mainly the Lohit. Mājuli is the abode of the Assamese neo-Vaishnavite culture.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 27, 2016 one more district was announced by Sarbananda Sonowal, taking the total number from 32 to 33. Majuli carved out of the Northern parts of Jorhat. It is the first river island district of India.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Administration</p>\r\n<p>Majuli district headed by the Deputy Commissioner (DC), which combines the offices of the District Magistrate ultimately responsible for maintaining law and order and District Collector responsible for collection of the revenue. Generally, an officer belonging to the Indian Administrative Service becomes the DC but occasionally officers belonging to the Assam Civil Service too get appointed. The DC is assisted by a number of officials belonging to different wings of the administrative services of the state.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Economy</p>\r\n<p>The main industry is agriculture, with paddy being the chief crop. Majuli has a rich and diverse agricultural tradition, with as many as 100 varieties of rice grown, all without pesticides or artificial fertilisers.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Handloom is a major occupation among the distaff population of the villages. Although largely a non-commercial occupation, it keeps many of the inhabitants occupied. Weaving is exquisite and intricate with the use of a variety of colours and textures of cotton and silk, especially Muga silk.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Among the fascinating arrays of rice produced are the Komal Saul, a unique type that can be eaten after immersing the grains in warm water for 15 minutes and usually eaten as a breakfast cereal; the bao dhan, that grows under water and is harvested after ten months and the Bora saul, a sticky brown rice used to make the traditional cake known as pitha. Fishing, dairying, pottery, handloom and boat-making are other important economic activities.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Politics</p>\r\n<p>Majuli (Vidhan Sabha constituency) falls under the 99 constituency of legislative assembly of Assam. It is a reserved seat for the Scheduled tribes (ST). Majuli is one of the 9 assembly segments of Lakhimpur Lok Sabha constituency. At present Sarbananda Sonowal (2014-) is the Member of Parliament from Bharatiya Janata Party and was the Union Minister of State-Independent Charge for Sports &amp; Youth Affairs, Skill Development &amp; Entrepreneurship but resigned after becoming Chef Minister of Assam.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is under jurisdiction of Mising Autonomous Council having three constituencies. Rajib Lochan Pegu won the seat [2001-2006 &amp; 2006-2011, 2011- 2016] was MLA from Mājuli in Assam Assembly until 2016. He was bearing the portfolio of Minister of State (Ind.), Water Resources Dev., WPT &amp; BC, in the Government of Assam.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Culture</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Gayan Bayan in Majuli</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Raas leela in Majuli</p>\r\n<p>The festival of Ali aye ligang is celebrated during mid-February with great pomp and show. It is celebrated for five days starting from second Wednesday of February till the next week. Local dishes like purang apin (rice wrapped in special leaves), apong (rice beer) and dishes made of pork, fish and chickens are served. Traditional Mising dance Gumrag Soman is performed in every village worshiping the almighty Donyi polo (mother sun and father moon) asking for good year of harvest.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Other festivals like Christmas is celebrated by the majority Christians of Mising tribe in upper Majuli where Jengraimukh village is the epicentre of Christians. Majuli has been the cultural capital and the cradle of Assamese civilization for the past 500 years. The satras set up preserve antiques like weapons, utensils, jewellery and other items of cultural significance. Pottery is made in Mājuli from beaten clay and burnt in driftwood fired kilns in the same mode carried out by the peoples of the ancient Harappan Civilisation. Sociologists have stressed the preservation of these unique peoples, whose culture and dance forms are untouched by modernism. The hand-loom work of these tribes is internationally famous.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tourist interests</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>FALGU RATH YATRA (narasingha satra)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the north bank is the river Subansiri and on the south bank, the mighty Brahmaputra has excided[clarification needed] the island from the main land.
