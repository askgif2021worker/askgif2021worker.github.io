This was their seventh loss against the Men in Blue in all the editions of the World Cups.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The entire team, including skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed and the team management, had drawn a lot of flak from former cricketers and fans on social media.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, Pakistan came back strongly to keep their hopes alive of making it to the semi-finals as they registered a convincing 49-run victory over South Africa, knocking the Faf du Plessis-led team out of the competition.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"Last Sunday I wanted to commit suicide,\" Arthur said at the post-match press conference after the Proteas game at the Lord's on Sunday. \"But it was, you know, it's only one performance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"It happens so quick. You lose a game; you lose another game; it's a World Cup; media scrutiny; public expectation, and then you almost go into sort of survival mode. We've all been there,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He had also said guys in the team were \"burnt\" last week post their defeat to Virat Kohli's men.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pakistan has five points from six games and is currently placed at the seventh spot in the table. They need to win all their remaining three games against New Zealand (Wednesday), Afghanistan (Saturday) and Bangladesh (July 5), and also hope that results of matches of other teams go in their favor so that they can make it to the last four stages.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It should be remembered that former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer had died under mysterious circumstances after the Green Brigade got eliminated in the group stage of the 2007 edition of the World Cup held in the West Indies.</p>\r\n<p>source: https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket-world-cup-2019/story/icc-cricket-world-cup-pakistan-head-coach-mickey-arthur-wanted-suicide-sunday-1555695-2019-06-25</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/23dffb88-fd1a-4cce-951d-a5d1d42ef99d_ind-vs-pak.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"slug":"world-cup-2019-wanted-to-commit-suicide-after-shameful-defeat-to-india-says-pakistan-coach-mickey-arthur","tags":[{"name":"cricket","slug":"cricket"},{"name":"pakistan","slug":"pakistan"}],"recommendations":[{"id":383,"title":"Story of Flt Lt Alfred Tyrone Cooke: IAF’s unsung 1965 hero & his classic 1 vs 4 air combat","imageUrl":"30c2bcc0-04a6-45b4-a093-7253f1e68fd3_Alfred-Cooke-shooting-down-the-Sabre-of-Afzal-Khan.jpg","dateCreated":"2019-05-14T17:09:28.914Z","dateModified":"2020-04-05T07:12:46.308Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"THE STORY OF ARGUABLY THE GREATEST FIGHTER PILOT OF THE INDIAN AIR FORCE &mdash; WHO TENACIOUSLY ENGAGED FOUR PAKISTAN AIR FORCE SABRE JETS ALL ALONE IN A FIESTY AERIAL DUEL\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHOW A DARING IAF FIGHTER PILOT ENGAGED WITH PAKISTAN AIR FORCE JETS OVER THE SKIES OF KALAIKUNDA AFB","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/30c2bcc0-04a6-45b4-a093-7253f1e68fd3_Alfred-Cooke-shooting-down-the-Sabre-of-Afzal-Khan.jpg","category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"tags":[{"name":"pakistan","slug":"pakistan"},{"name":"india","slug":"india"},{"name":"alfred-cooke","slug":"alfred-cooke"}],"slug":"story-of-flt-lt-alfred-tyrone-cooke-iafs-unsung-1965-hero-his-classic-1-vs-4-air-combat","total":0},{"id":291,"title":"Balakot air strikes count revealed! 263 terrorists had assembled at JeM camp in Pak for training - EXCLUSIVE","imageUrl":"9bdaee4e-261e-4e41-a452-05027b04ebae_Indian-air-strikes.jpg","dateCreated":"2019-03-11T15:42:03.866Z","dateModified":"2019-03-11T15:42:03.866Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"New Delhi: Amid the ongoing war of words in India over the number of terrorists killed in Balakot air strikes carried out by the Indian Air Force on the biggest terror training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan, Times Now has learned that a total of 263 terrorists had assembled at the facility","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/9bdaee4e-261e-4e41-a452-05027b04ebae_Indian-air-strikes.jpg","category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"tags":[{"name":"india","slug":"india"},{"name":"pakistan","slug":"pakistan"}],"slug":"balakot-air-strikes-count-revealed-263-terrorists-had-assembled-at-jem-camp-in-pak-for-training-exclusive","total":0},{"id":286,"title":"Terrorist Maulana Masood Azhar, head of Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammad, dead","imageUrl":"c444af1b-14e9-4a06-9058-eb133b3cee93_masood-azhar.jpg","dateCreated":"2019-03-03T13:15:48.375Z","dateModified":"2019-03-03T13:18:14.769Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Jaish-e-Mohammad Chief Maulana Masood Azhar is reportedly dead.
