Navsari is also the Twin City of Surat, and only 30 km south of Surat. In 2016, Navsari ranked as the 16th biggest city of Gujarat state of india by population in 2011. It used to rank 10th in 1991 to 2001. Navsari is the 25th \"cleanest city of India\" according to the Indian Ministry of Urban Development.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Landmarks</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Meherjirana library.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is one of the oldest libraries in South Gujarat Region. It was established by the first Dastur (Parsi/Zoroastrian priest) Meherjirana, who was also born in Navsari. He was invited by Akbar in a religious programme organized by the Great Akbar. Leaders of all religious groups participated in it. Akbar asked to start a conversation and eventually asked to give information about their religion. All the religious leaders gave information about their religions and gradually tried to show their religions as great except Dastur Meherjirana. Afterward, the leaders asked Akbar his opinion as to whose religion is great. Akbar was really impressed by Dastur Meherjirana, so he asked him. Meherjirana Dastur calmly replied, \"All religions are equal in terms of strength and ideology and principle\". Akbar was extremely impressed by his personality. He donated a piece of land to Dastur Meherjirana in Navsari, where today The Meherjirana Library stands. Akbar wrote on a scroll about the donation of land which is still preserved by the management of the library.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dandi</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Dandi seashore is an important location from the point of view of India's Independence Movement. In 1930 Mahatma Gandhi started the \"Dandi March\" from Sabarmati Ashram up to the Dandi seashore to protest against a tax on salt by the colonial government.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ajmalgadh</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Though it is surrounded by high hills, this is a historical place. Zoroastrians/Parsis roamed in the forest and cave of Ajmalgadh to save and protect their sacred fire-cauldron for nearly 250&ndash;350 years. Recently, local administration constructed a pillar on the hill of Ajmalgadh describing the story. They also closed the cave which was used to protect the holy fire.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Transportation</p>\r\n<p>The nearest domestic airport is at Vadodara Airport, 170 km north of Navsari, with the nearest international airports being Surat Airport at Magdalla, Surat, 48 km.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Navsari also lies on the Mumbai-Delhi railway link, one of the busiest railway routes in India.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Navsari is well connected by NH 228 also known as Sabarmati-Dandi Highway.
