It is one of the categories of river crossing puzzles, where a number of objects must move across a river, with some constraints.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Four people come to a river in the night. There is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time. They have one torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. Person A can cross the bridge in 1 minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, and D in 10 minutes. When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace. The question is, what is the minimum time taken by them to cross the bridge?</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/303f3817-358f-471c-bd00-e6c4e01bfc0b_bridge-riddle.jpg","subContents":[{"SubTitle":"Answer","SubTitleHindi":null,"SubContent":"<p>A and B cross the bridge.
