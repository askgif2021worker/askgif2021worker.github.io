According to the 2001 Indian census, the town is situated on the banks of the Ravi River (a major tributary of the Trans-Himalayan Indus River), at its confluence with the Sal River. Chambial were the Rulers of Chamba State&nbsp; Chambials use suffix Varmans.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Though historical records date the history of the Chamba region to the Kolian tribes in the 2nd century BC, the area was formally ruled by the Maru dynasty, starting with the Raju Maru from around 500 AD, ruling from the ancient capital of Bharmour, which is located 65 kilometres (40 mi) from the town of Chamba. In 920, Raja Sahil Varman (or Raja Sahil Verma) shifted the capital of the kingdom to Chamba, following the specific request of his daughter Champavati&nbsp; (Chamba was named after her). From the time of Raju Maru, 67 Rajas of this dynasty ruled over Chamba until it finally merged with the Indian Union in April 1948, although Chamba was under British suzerainty from 1846 to this time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The town has numerous temples and palaces, and hosts two popular jatras (fairs), the \"Suhi Mata Mela\" and the \"Minjar Mela\", which last for several days of music and dancing. Chamba is also well noted for its arts and crafts, particularly its Pahari paintings, which originated in the Hill Kingdoms of North India between the 17th and 19th century, and its handicrafts and textiles.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Landmarks and cityscape</p>\r\n<p>The city layout can be distinctly demarcated into two zones; namely the 'Old Town' before the British introduced their urban architectural styles and the British period of contemporary monuments, bridges and buildings. In a study of the architecture of Chamba, instituted by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), with the objective of conserving and restoring individual heritage buildings, it has been observed that the urban architecture of Chamba evolved under three distinct phases. The first phase from 930, dating from the Rajput dynasty establishing the capital at Chamba until 1846, the second phase during the British period; and the third phase constituting the post independent period after its merger with the Indian Union in April 1948.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Education</p>\r\n<p>Schools</p>\r\n<p>Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Chamba is located in Sarol.</p>\r\n<p>Interesting places</p>\r\n<p>In Banikhet:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Laxmi Narayan Temple : It is the most famous tourist attraction place in Chamba.
