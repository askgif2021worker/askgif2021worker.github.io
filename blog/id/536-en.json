The present administrative centre is Keylong in Lahaul. Before the two districts were merged, Kardang was the capital of Lahaul, and Dhankar the capital of Spiti. The district was formed in 1960, and is the fourth least populous district in India (out of 640).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kunzum la or the Kunzum Pass (altitude 4,551 m (14,931 ft)) is the entrance pass to the Spiti Valley from Lahaul. It is 21 km (13 mi) from Chandra Tal. This district is connected to Manali through the Rohtang Pass. To the south, Spiti ends 24 km (15 mi) from Tabo, at the Sumdo where the road enters Kinnaur and joins with National Highway No. 5 .</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The two valleys are quite different in character. Spiti is more barren and difficult to cross, with an average elevation of the valley floor of 4,270 m (14,010 ft). It is enclosed between lofty ranges, with the Spiti river rushing out of a gorge in the southeast to meet the Sutlej River. It is a typical mountain desert area with an average annual rainfall of only 170 mm (6.7 in).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tourism</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The natural scenery and Buddhist monasteries, such as Kye, Dhankar, Shashur, Guru Ghantal, Khungri Monastery in Pin Valley, Tnagyud Gompa of the Sakya Sect in Komic, Sherkhang Gompa in Lahlung (believed to be older than Tabo Monastery), the only Buddhist Mummy of a Monk in Gue around 550 years old and Chandra Taal Lake are the main tourist attractions of the region.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of the most interesting places is the Tabo Monastery, located 45 km from Kaza, Himachal Pradesh, the capital of the Spiti region. This monastery rose to prominence when it celebrated its thousandth year of existence in 1996. It houses a collection of Buddhist scriptures, Buddhist statues and Thangkas. The ancient gompa is finished with mud plaster, and contains several scriptures and documents. Lama Dzangpo heads the gompa here. There is a modern guest house with a dining hall and all facilities are available.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another gompa, Kardang Monastery, is located at an elevation of 3,500 metres across the river, about 8 km from Keylong. Kardang is well connected by the road via the Tandi bridge which is about 14 km from Keylong. Built in the 12th century, this monastery houses a large library of Buddhist literature including the main Kangyur and Tangyur scriptures.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The treacherous weather in Lahaul and Spiti permits visitors to tour only between the months of June to October, when the roads and villages are free of snow and the high passes (Rothang La and Kunzum La) are open. It is possible to access Spiti from Kinnaur (along the Sutlej) all through the year, although the road is sometimes temporarily closed by landslides or avalanches.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Buddhist Monasteries</p>\r\n<p>Spiti is one of the important centers of Buddhism in Himachal Pradesh. It is popularly known as the 'land of lamas'. The valley is dotted by numerous Buddhist Monasteries or Gompas.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kye Monastery: Kye Monastery is one of the main learning centres of Buddhist studies in Spiti. The monastery is house to some 100 odd monks who receive education here. It is the oldest and biggest monastery in Spiti. It houses rare paintings and scriptures of Buddha and other gods and goddess. There are also rare 'Thangka' paintings and ancient musical instruments 'trumpets, cymbals, and drums in the monastery.[citation needed]</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tabo Monastery: Perched at an altitude of 3050 meters, Tabo Monastery is often referred to as the 'Ajanta of the Himalayas'. The 10th century Tabo Monastery was founded by the great scholar, Richen Zangpo. The monastery houses more than 60 lamas and contains the rare collection of scriptures, pieces of art, wall paintings -Thankas and Stucco.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Adventure activities</p>\r\n<p>To-do-Trails: For trekkers, the Spiti Valley is a paradise, offering challenging treks to explore the new heights of the Himalayas. The treks take people to the most remote areas including the rugged villages and old Gompas followed by the exotic wildlife trails. Some of the trekking routes in the area include Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki-Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako. There are some very high altitude treks also where you have to cross passes- like Parangla Pass (connecting Ladakh with Spiti Valley), Pin Parvati Pass, Baba Pass, Hamta Pass trek, Spiti Left Bank Trek are few to name.[tone]</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Skiing: Skiing is the popular adventure sports in Spiti.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Yak Safari: Yak can be used to see the flora and fauna of trans-Himalayan desert.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaul_and_Spiti_district</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/44e7169f-dc4f-4543-9d90-5eeb8d58a0df_Lahaul-and-Spiti.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"travel","slug":"travel"},"slug":"top-places-to-visit-in-lahaul-and-spiti-kyelang-himachal-pradesh","tags":[{"name":"kyelang","slug":"kyelang"},{"name":"lahaul and spiti","slug":"lahaul and spiti"},{"name":"himachal-pradesh","slug":"himachal-pradesh"}],"recommendations":[{"id":540,"title":"Top Places to visit in Solan, Himachal Pradesh","imageUrl":"fc3ca1cf-81ce-4671-bbb1-a20b4972652b_Solan-railway.jpg","dateCreated":"2019-09-01T06:31:46.999Z","dateModified":"2019-09-01T06:32:00.097Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Solan is the district headquarters of Solan district (created on 1 September 1972) in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.
