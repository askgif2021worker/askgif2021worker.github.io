Its inflammatory effects cause the eyes to close, taking away vision. This temporary blindness allows officers to more easily restrain subjects and permits people in danger to use pepper spray in self-defense for an opportunity to escape. Although considered a less-than-lethal agent, it has been deadly in rare cases, and concerns have been raised about a number of deaths where being pepper sprayed may have been a contributing factor.</p>","SubContentHindi":null,"ImageUrl":"5cb8e286-d767-4e78-a829-4e33c8b1cedc_Pepper-Spray-for-Security-of-Women.jpg","HdImageUrl":null,"gifUrl":null,"Priority":"1"},{"SubTitle":"2.
