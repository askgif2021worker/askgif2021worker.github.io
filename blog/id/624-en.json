The Kerala High Court, the office of the Kochi Municipal Corporation and the Cochin Stock Exchange are situated here. The Ernakulam Junction is a major railway station of the Indian Railways. Initially, Ernakulam was the headquarters of the Ernakulam District but was later shifted to Kakkanad. Ernakulam was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin. It is located 220 kilometres (137 mi) north-west of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. The city has served as an incubator for many Malayali entrepreneurs and is a major financial and commercial hub of Kerala.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The state government and the GCDA have plans to include Angamaly, Perumbavoor, Piravom and Kolenchery in the Ernakulam district; Mala and Kodungallur in the Thrissur district; Thalayolaparambu and Vaikom in Kottayam; and Cherthala in the Alappuzha district within the Kochi metropolitan limits. The newly formed metropolis would be put under the charge of a new authority called Kochi Metropolitan Regional Development Authority.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Landmarks/tourist spots</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A night view of Marine Drive, Kochi</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Durbar Hall Ground</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam</p>\r\n<p>Marine Drive, Kochi</p>\r\n<p>Durbar Hall Ground</p>\r\n<p>Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary</p>\r\n<p>Bolghatty</p>\r\n<p>Wonderla Kochi</p>\r\n<p>LuLu International Shopping Mall</p>\r\n<p>Mahatma Gandhi Road (Kochi)</p>\r\n<p>Sahodaran Ayyappan Road (Kochi).</p>\r\n<p>Maharajas College ground with Synthetic Athletic track</p>\r\n<p>Jawahar Lal Nehru International Stadium, Kaloor</p>\r\n<p>Rajeev Gandhi Indoor Stadium, Kadavathara</p>\r\n<p>Kerala High Court</p>\r\n<p>Subhash Park</p>\r\n<p>Children's Park</p>\r\n<p>Changampuzha Park</p>\r\n<p>B.R.

Ernakulam is well served by private/government buses, autorickshaws, long and short distance trains and ferries. Ernakulam has a number of jetties where passengers can embark and disembark from ferries. Traveling via ferries is cheaper and faster than traveling by buses and/or autos. The main jetty is called the Ernakulam jetty from where one can board a ferry to Vypin, Fort Kochi, Mattancherry and Willingdon Island.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Road</p>\r\n<p>Ernakulam is connected to the North-South Corridor National Highway System via the four-laned National Highway 66.

NH 66 provides two main exit points at Edapally and Vytilla to the Ernakulam city. The city is largely dependent on city buses, taxis and auto rickshaws (called autos) for public transport.
