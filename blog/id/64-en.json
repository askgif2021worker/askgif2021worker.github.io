A locomotive, carriage and wagon workshop was set up in Howrah to put to commission imported rolling stock of EIR and also to render economic repairs to them but it proved unsuccessful because of problems with procuring supplies and getting skilled labor. The railways spread very fast, perhaps faster than the anticipation of EIR. Within a short span of eight years, it became necessary to shift the site of the workshop, as there was hardly any scope for expansion at Howrah. And then Jamalpur Workshop was established at Jamalpur.</p>","SubContentHindi":null,"ImageUrl":"e78fb2a1-4a74-48e9-aa13-39dfca04d0cd_jamalpur-workshop.jpg","HdImageUrl":null,"gifUrl":null,"Priority":"1"},{"SubTitle":"2.
