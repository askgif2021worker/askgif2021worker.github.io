Harda is the administrative headquarters of Harda District.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>History</p>\r\n<p>During the Mughal period, Harda was a mahal in the Handia sarkar. In 1742, Marathas led by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao captured the area, and displaced the Muslim governor of the Handia sarkar. Subsequently, Harda replaced Handia as the most important town in the area, as the local Maratha amil (chief) resided at Harda. Harda was a part of the Scindia's territories. In 1801, Yashwantrao Holkar sacked Harda. Later, Harda also faced attacks from the Pindaris and the Korku tribals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 1817, during the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Harda became the headquarters of John Malcolm's division. Even after the Maratha defeat ini the war, the Scindias retained control of the Harda-Handia tract. The area was ceded to the British in 1844, but the cession was completed only in 1860. The town saw disturbances during the 1857 uprising. The Deputy Magistrate, Maulvi Mazhar-ul-Jamil, helped curb the rebellion, and was rewarded with a jagir in the Damoh district. The Harda Nagar Palika was established on 18 May 1867, and the Harda tehsil was created in 1913.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The British tried to bring a progressive frame work to Harda during its rule. Harda was formed by combining Kul Harda and Mehmudabad Villages. After the railway lines were laid the conditions improved, and the area developed. In 1857 British officers worked here as judges and administrative Officers. Harda was one of the largest places in the old 'Madhya Prant' and includes area of 'Seoni Malwa.' The Harda language and culture is influenced by 'Malwa' and 'Nimar'. The main dialect spoken in Harda is known as Bhuani, and the region is known as the Bhuana area which loosely translates to more fertilized land.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Harda was the headquarters of a tehsil in the Hoshangabad district. The Harda district was created in 1998.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Government and Politics</p>\r\n<p>Harda has as an assembly seat in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly with the same name i.e. Harda and the current MLA is Kamal Patel from the BJP Madhya Pradesh.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Flora and fauna</p>\r\n<p>In the southern hill regions of Harda we can find the Tribal, 'Gond' and 'Korku' people. The south region of Harda was under 'Makdae' rule and the 'Gond' king was the ruler. The 'Bihola' village of harda was the developed 'Rajaswa' center in the Mughal empire. The area which was called as 'Gondwana' became non-tribal(it is still tribal because there is a vast tribal population) during the British rule, as the workers, administration officials, farmers and business community was in touch with the states like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat for a 150 years the area got influenced by the culture of these states.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Administration</p>\r\n<p>On 18 May 1867 British established the 'Nagar Palika' in Harda and from 1920 the work was done as per the republic manner. The under ground drainage in Harda is best example of the British architect. For administration purposes Tahsil Harda was established in the year 1913.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Indian independence movement</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This article needs additional citations for verification.
