The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern. The decorator pattern is structurally nearly identical to the chain of responsibility pattern, the difference being that in a chain of responsibility, exactly one of the classes handles the request, while for the decorator, all classes handle the request.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Decorator design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known GoF design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What problems can the Decorator design pattern solve?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Responsibilities should be added to (and removed from) an object dynamically at run-time.</p>\r\n<p>A flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality should be provided.</p>\r\n<p>When using subclassing, different subclasses extend a class in different ways.
