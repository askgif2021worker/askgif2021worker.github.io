It is the district headquarters as well as the main urban hub of Mokokchung district. Mokokchung is the cultural nervecentre of the Ao people and is economically and politically the most important urban centre in northern Nagaland. In fact it is third most important urban hub in all of Nagaland after Dimapur and Kohima. Besides this the Government of Nagaland has also recognised Mokokchung district as 'Land of Pioneers' because this place has produced a great number of luminaries in many fields. The town is made up of 16 wards of which Kumlong, Sangtemla, Alempang and Yimyu are the largest. Mokokchung is particularly noted for its extravagant Christmas, New Year, Moatsu and Tsungremong celebrations. Its tradition of celebrating Christmas and New Year midnight celebrations in the main town square is regarded as one of the unique features of Mokokchung. Historically, Mokokchung was one of the first Naga Hills sites where the Assam Rifles, led by Britishers, established their outposts (then called stockades) in the later part of the 19th century. Much of the town initially grew around this post located in the DC Hill. The British administration was then gradually extended eastwards towards the remoter parts of the Naga Hills.</p>\r\n<p>Mokokchung is a district of Nagaland state in India. The town of Mokokchung is its headquarters. It is mainly occupied by the Ao Naga tribe who consider it their home. It is bounded by the state of Assam to its north, Wokha district to its west, Tuensang and Longleng district to its east, and Zunheboto district to its south.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Geography</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>District map of Nagaland with Mokokchung city</p>\r\n<p>Mokokchung is located at 26.33&deg;N 94.53&deg;E. It is located at an elevation of 1325 metres above sea level.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Mokokchung has a mild climate throughout the year. For ten months of the year, maximum temperature hovers in the mid twenties. Mokokchung also witnesses a lot of mist in the rainy months.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Transport</p>\r\n<p>Mokokchung's central location has helped it to be the converging point of maximum number of highways and hence it is better connected to most areas of Nagaland when compared to Kohima and Dimapur. Besides, every village and settlement of the district is well linked to the town by district and community roads.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Major Highways that pass through Mokokchung are:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>NH 2 ( Dibrugarh, Mokokchung, Kohima, Imphal, Churachandpur, Seling, Tuipang)</p>\r\n<p>NH 202 (Mokokchung, Tuensang, Jessami, Imphal)</p>\r\n<p>NH 702D Mokokchung-Mariani-Jorhat Highway</p>\r\n<p>Mokokchung-Chare</p>\r\n<p>Mokokchung-Noksen</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Art and culture</p>\r\n<p>Mokokchung is the intellectual and cultural capital of Nagaland. From the late 19th century, through the 20th century and continuing in the present times, the sons and daughters of Mokokchung have excelled and led the state in every field. Mokokchung is the home and venue of \"Naga Idol\", a talent search contest on the lines of \"American Idol\". Naga Idol show holds the distinction of having garnered the highest TV viewership and record sales in Nagaland. It official website is http://www.nagaidol.com</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Politics</p>\r\n<p>Mokokchung has political importance in Nagaland. Apart from Mokokchung town constituency, parts of the town fall under three other state assembly constituencies&mdash;namely, Aonglenden and Mongoya&mdash;thus making the town the deciding factor in 3 of 60 assembly seats in the state legislature. Leaders from the town played a major role in brokering a deal with the Government of India at the height of the Indo-Naga conflict in the 1950s, resulting in the formation of Nagaland state as the 16th state of India in 1963.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Over the last two decades, Mokokchung has become a stronghold of the Indian National Congress party which can be partly attributed to the fact that the party was led by S. Chubatoshi Jamir whose constituency was Aonglenden. In the 2003 general Assembly elections, Indian National Congress won Aonglenden, Mongoya and Mokokchung town constituencies while Koridang constituency was won by an Independent candidate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Notable political leaders:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>P.
