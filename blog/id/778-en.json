Even after the British conquest of India, the Tuensang tribal region remained unadministered due to lack of sufficient men and money. However, in 1902, the area was brought under the nominal control of the British. It was called Tribal Area and was administered by the Governor General of India. In 1948, a separate division called Tuensang Administrative Circle was created.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When the Constitution of India was first released in 1950, Tuensang Division was placed in \"Part B\" category of tribal districts as per the Sixth Schedule. It became part of the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). Subsequently, in 1957, it was merged with the Naga Hills District to form a new administrative unit under the Ministry of External Affairs. After negotiation with the secessionists, this administrative unit was later made a full-fledged state called Nagaland.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Geography</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>District map of Nagaland with Tuensang town</p>\r\n<p>Tuensang is located at 26.28&deg;N 94.83&deg;E.
