The research found positive antidepressant effects of resveratrol, but the relationship of the compound to phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme influenced by the stress hormone corticosterone remained undetermined. The research also showed that PDE4 induced by a high influx of corticosterone can cause behaviour akin to anxiety and depression. The enzyme lowers cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a molecule that leads to physical alterations in the brain by signaling physiological changes like cell division, change, and death.</p>","SubContentHindi":null,"ImageUrl":"c2c2889e-26a7-48a3-882c-75f2b33d03f4_red-wine-study.jpg","HdImageUrl":null,"gifUrl":null,"Priority":"3"},{"SubTitle":"4.

One of the most severe consequences of regular alcohol consumption is liver cirrhosis, a liver disease that can be fatal. Heavy drinking can conversely lead to an increased risk of anxiety and depression, to curb which you will resort to drinking more, creating a vicious cycle of alcohol dependence.
