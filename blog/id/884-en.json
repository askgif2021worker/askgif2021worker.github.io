Geographically, East Sikkim occupies the south-east corner of the state. The capital of East Sikkim is Gangtok, which is also the state capital. It is the hub of all administrative activity in the state.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The civilian region is administered by a district collector, appointed by the State Government and the military area by a Major General. As of 2011 it is the most populous of the four districts of Sikkim.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Gangtok is a city, municipality, the capital and the largest town of the Indian state of Sikkim. It also is the headquarters of the East Sikkim district. Gangtok is in the eastern Himalayan range, at an elevation of 1,650 m (5,410 ft). The town's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as Bhutia, Lepchas and Nepalis. Within the higher peaks of the Himalaya and with a year-round mild temperate climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Gangtok rose to prominence as a popular Buddhist pilgrimage site after the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese Chogyal, Thutob Namgyal, transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route between Lhasa in Tibet and cities such as Kolkata (then Calcutta) in British India. After India won its independence from Britain in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Assembly Constituencies</p>\r\n<p>The district was previously divided into 12 assembly constituencies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Khamdong-Singtam</p>\r\n<p>West Pendam(SC)</p>\r\n<p>Rhenock</p>\r\n<p>Chujachen</p>\r\n<p>Gnathang-Machong(BL)</p>\r\n<p>Namcheybung</p>\r\n<p>Shyari(BL)</p>\r\n<p>Martam-Rumtek (BL)</p>\r\n<p>Upper Tadong</p>\r\n<p>Arithang</p>\r\n<p>Gangtok(BL)</p>\r\n<p>Upper Burtuk</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Transport</p>\r\n<p>Road</p>\r\n<p>Taxis are the most widely available public transport within Gangtok. Most of the residents stay within a few kilometres of the town centre and many have their own vehicles such as two-wheelers and cars. The share of personal vehicles and taxis combined is 98% of Gangtok's total vehicles, a high percentage when compared to other Indian cities. City buses comprise less than one percent of vehicles. Those travelling longer distances generally make use of share-jeeps, a kind of public taxis. Four wheel drives are used to easily navigate the steep slopes of the roads. The 1 km (0.6 mi) long cable car with three stops connects lower Gangtok suburbs with Sikkim Legislative assembly in central Gangtok and the upper suburbs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Gangtok is connected to the rest of India by an all-weather metalled highway, National Highway 10, earlier known as National Highway 31A, which links Gangtok to Siliguri, located 114 km (71 mi) away in the neighbouring state of West Bengal. The highway also provides a link to the neighbouring hill station towns of Darjeeling and Kalimpong, which are the nearest urban areas. Regular jeep, van, and bus services link these towns to Gangtok. Gangtok is a linear city that has developed along the arterial roads, especially National Highway 31A. Most of the road length in Gangtok is of two lane undivided carriageway with footpath on one side of the road and drain on the other. The steep gradient of the different road stretches coupled with a spiral road configuration constrain the smooth flow of vehicular as well as pedestrian traffic.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rail</p>\r\n<p>The nearest railhead connected to the rest of India is the station of New Jalpaiguri (NJP) in Siliguri, situated 124 km (77 mi) via NH10 away from Gangtok. Work has commenced for a broad gauge railway link from Sevoke in West Bengal to Rangpo in Sikkim that is planned for extension to Gangtok. As of August 2019, this line with 200 bridges and many tunnels is expected to be completed by December 2024. Once completed, further extionsion plans include a 150 km long eastern spur to Paro Airport (upgraded by India and jointly used by the Indian Army and Bhutan Army) in western Bhutan.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Air</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Runway at Pakyong Airport, is the first greenfield airport to be constructed in the Northeast India.</p>\r\n<p>Pakyong Airport is a greenfield airport near Gangtok, the state capital of Sikkim, India. The airport, spread over 400 ha (990 acres), is located at Pakyong town about 35 km (22 mi) south of Gangtok. At 4500 ft, Pakyong Airport is one of the five highest airports in India. It is also the first greenfield airport to be constructed in the Northeastern Region of India, the 100th operational airport in India, and the only airport in the state of Sikkim.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The airport was inaugurated by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 24 September 2018 and the first commercial flight operations from the airport began on 4 October 2018 between Pakyong and Kolkata.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Education</p>\r\n<p>Gangtok's schools are either run by the state government or by private and religious organizations. Schools mainly use English and Nepali as their medium of instruction. The schools are either affiliated with the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education, Central Board of Secondary Education or the National Institute of Open Schooling. Notable schools include the Tashi Namgyal Academy, Paljor Namgyal Girls School, Holy Cross School, Taktse International School and Kendriya Vidyalaya.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Colleges conferring graduate degrees include Sikkim Government College, Sikkim Government Law College and Damber Singh College. Sikkim University established in 2007 is functioning in Gangtok; the university has been allotted land in neighbouring Yang Yang town for establishment of its own campus. The university offers a diverse range of courses and has a number of institutes affiliated to it. 8 km (5.0 mi) from here is the headquarters of the Sikkim Manipal University, which houses Sikkim Manipal Institute of Medical Sciences and Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology. The Indira Gandhi National Open University also has a regional center in the city. There are other institutions offering diplomas in Buddhist literature, catering and other non-mainstream fields. District Institute of Education and Training and State Institute of Education conduct teacher training programs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sikkim_district</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/03f531d4-4e85-43c5-ad8c-b1fd1547a781_Gangtok-tourism.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"travel","slug":"travel"},"slug":"top-places-to-visit-in-east-sikkim-gangtok-sikkim","tags":[{"name":"sikkim","slug":"sikkim"},{"name":"gangtok","slug":"gangtok"},{"name":"east-sikkim","slug":"east-sikkim"}],"recommendations":[{"id":888,"title":"Top Places to visit in West Sikkim, Geyzing, Sikkim","imageUrl":"ba0e2b5d-5993-4c0a-8a81-b6827b4be8d4_West-Sikkim-tourism.jpg","dateCreated":"2019-10-13T11:13:16.248Z","dateModified":"2019-10-13T11:13:37.414Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"West Sikkim is a district of the Indian state of Sikkim.
