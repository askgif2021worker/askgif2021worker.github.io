We are not saying this. A recent survey done by Comparably, a career site analyzer, across 50,000 employees has revealed that these are top tech companies to work with based on factors like fair pay to employees, satisfaction level with benefits, raises and likewise.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The findings reveal that the median estimated salary, including base and bonus, is more than Rs 94,71,455 ($134,000) a year. This will surely leave you wondering what would be the salary of employees working at Google and similar other tech companies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A report from Wired states that the median pay at Google's parent company Alphabet rose 25 percent last year to Rs 1.74 crore ($246,804)which is the biggest increase among a dozen of tech companies. As per the report, Google in 2017 paid only half of its typical awards. The employee compensation increased when the company resumed these \"full-size awards\" last year. The Comparably report shows that the highest-paid position at Google is the director of finance who is paid at Rs 4.24 crore ($600,000) a year.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Facebook seems to be struggling with new recruits as the company faced several crises last year. The company's median pay to employees fell 5 percent from Rs 1.76 crore ($248,430) to Rs 1.62 crore ($228,651) this year.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The median employee pay of tech companies like Twitter, Square, Workday, and Nvidia each in 2018 surpassed Rs 1.06 crore ($150,000) each.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The law to report median pay by the companies was introduced to highlight the income disparity and highlight corporate excess. While the other companies have to report their median pay since last year, this would be the second time that the tech companies have reported their median pay. The figures not just reveal some of the highest-paid positions in the company but also reflect on the reduced pay of thousands of workers to a single digit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>source: https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/here-is-how-much-employees-earn-in-companies-like-google-and-facebook-1616235-2019-11-06</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/d51fb183-cbe7-4b32-a8f4-5df672ebcb90_tech-giant.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"slug":"think-in-crore-and-lakhs-here-is-how-much-employees-earn-in-companies-like-google-and-facebook","tags":[{"name":"microsoft","slug":"microsoft"},{"name":"google","slug":"google"},{"name":"facebook","slug":"facebook"}],"recommendations":[{"id":958,"title":"Think in crore and lakhs, here is how much employees earn in companies like Google and Facebook","imageUrl":"d51fb183-cbe7-4b32-a8f4-5df672ebcb90_tech-giant.jpg","dateCreated":"2019-11-07T02:16:27.587Z","dateModified":"2020-04-05T07:12:25.767Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"Google is the top company to work with followed by Facebook and Microsoft at second and third spots respectively.
