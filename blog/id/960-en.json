It was a targeted attack probably brought about by the renewed media coverage [of the case],&rdquo; he said referring to parts of a confidential doctor&rsquo;s report on Nirav&rsquo;s depression leaked to the press.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He said the prison service failed to respond to the assaults and Nirav&rsquo;s request to see a counselor was also denied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nirav Modi has wrongly been called a &lsquo;billionaire diamantaire&rsquo; in the press so much assaults will happen again,&rdquo; Keith said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In evidence submitted to the court, Nirav said he would kill himself if his extradition to India was ordered and expressed his apprehension that he would not get a fair trial in India.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Nirav&rsquo;s barrister put forward a suggestion in lieu of jail of &ldquo;conditions akin to suspected terrorists&rdquo; &mdash; paid for by Nirav &mdash; whereby visitors would be allowed 9am to 9pm but their bags searched, there would be 24 hour security cameras on his house and 12-hour security guards, he would have restrictions on his phone and computer and be electronically tagged. This was because of the &ldquo;enormous difficulties preparing his defense from jail&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>source: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/nirav-modi-denied-bail-again/articleshow/71945056.cms</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/ca9f0a83-9008-4c65-8b84-7ef51cdb1293_nirav-modi.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"slug":"nirav-modi-said-he-will-kill-himself-if-extradited-to-india","tags":[{"name":"jail","slug":"jail"}],"recommendations":[{"id":960,"title":"Nirav Modi said he will kill himself if extradited to India","imageUrl":"ca9f0a83-9008-4c65-8b84-7ef51cdb1293_nirav-modi.jpg","dateCreated":"2019-11-07T03:00:25.474Z","dateModified":"2020-04-05T07:12:22.253Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"LONDON: Jailed diamantaire Nirav Modi told a UK court on Wednesday that he was beaten up &ldquo;three times&rdquo; in prison and threatened to kill himself if his extradition to India is ordered, but still a UK judge refused to grant him bail.&nbsp;\r\nThe 49-year-old appeared at the Westmin","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/ca9f0a83-9008-4c65-8b84-7ef51cdb1293_nirav-modi.jpg","category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"tags":[{"name":"jail","slug":"jail"}],"slug":"nirav-modi-said-he-will-kill-himself-if-extradited-to-india","total":0},{"id":886,"title":"Arrest warrant issued against Bollywood actress Ameesha Patel","imageUrl":"f3d405cc-f968-4a57-9de0-e850900d9926_ameesha.jpg","dateCreated":"2019-10-13T08:08:09.946Z","dateModified":"2020-04-05T07:12:29.008Z","contributedBy":"AskGif","content":"A Ranchi court has issued an arrest warrant against Bollywood actress Ameesha Patel in a cheating and cheque bounce case, police said on Saturday.
