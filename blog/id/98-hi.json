In stack the order in which the data arrives is important. The pile of plates of a cafeteria is a good example of a stack. The plates are added to the stack as they are cleaned. They are placed on the top. When a plate is required it is taken from the top of the stack. The first plate placed on the stack is the last one to be used.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;A Stack is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at one end, called as the top.
