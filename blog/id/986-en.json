Advocate Pawan Kumar lodged a complaint against the Owaisi at the Jahangirabad police station over his remarks on the Ayodhya verdict on Saturday. The complaint has been registered against Owaisi for inciting a section of the population with his remarks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Soon after the Supreme Court pronounced its verdict favoring the construction of Ram Mandir on the disputed land in Ayodhya, Owaisi had said that the offer of 5 acres of land should not be accepted and the land should be rejected.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"Muslims are poor, but we can collect money to buy a 5-acre plot and build a mosque. We do not want your charity,\" said Owaisi and came under fire for his remarks on November 9.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Congress leader Salman Nizami asked why should 5 acres of land be rejected. Salman Nizami said that the Muslims should build a mosque and an institution where both Hindu and Muslim children can study together. \"No one needs to be disappointed. Only positive energy and thoughts can deal with hatred,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What did Owaisi say</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Raising questions on the historic judgment pronounced by the Supreme Court on Saturday, Asaduddin Owaisi said, \"Like the Muslim Personal Law Board, we are not convinced with the decision. The Supreme Court may be supreme but it is not infallible. Those who demolished the Babri Masjid have been given the task of building a Ram temple by building a trust.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>source: https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/fir-lodged-against-owaisi-over-ayodhya-verdict-comments-1618000-2019-11-11</p>","ampImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitc91/AmpImage/main/Blogs/d0ea26e3-62dc-4a53-9c49-cf73b86f5d27_Owaisi.jpg","subContents":[],"category":{"name":"news","slug":"news"},"slug":"a-complaint-has-been-lodged-against-owaisi-over-his-dont-need-charity-land-remark-on-ayodhya-verdict-by-supreme-court","tags":[{"name":"india","slug":"india"}],"recommendations":[{"id":1453,"title":"We Donâ€™t Even Smoke Cigarettes, Said Deepika, Sara, Rakul & Shraddha: NCB Official","imageUrl":"icon_6f5d95b4-82c9-4928-9870-bc03267cd84a.png","dateCreated":"2020-09-28T10:00:36.929Z","dateModified":"2020-09-28T10:00:53.091Z","contributedBy":"sumitc91","content":"An NBA official has revealed that all the four Bollywood actresses, Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Singh and Shraddha Kapoor, who were recently questioned by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), have denied substance abuse.
